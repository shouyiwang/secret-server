When I was born, I had these two spots on my ribcage below my nipples. We didn’t think much of them, and just though they were moles. I went into puberty at around 9, and a little over a year later, after my breasts had started developing, I noticed the “moles” were starting to get slightly bigger as well, slightly showing little bumps on them, similar to my nipples. At 10, I had an examination where we were told they were in fact nipples. I was kind of scared, but the doctors were unsure whether or not there was going to be any extra breast tissue with the nipples in the future. When I was 11, my normal breasts were almost B-cups, and at this point, the two other ‘breasts’ had been growing for some time too, becoming a slightly raised area around the extra nipples. Now that I’m 14, I have a pair of D-cups with a pair of C-cups right below them. All breasts and nipples are properly shaped and look like normal. I usually go braless, and wear baggy clothes since not many people at school know about it and I don’t want them to know.", category: "a wild experience", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

I trained his asshole during the fall term, and started fucking him when we returned to school in January.  But, after a bud managed to talk him into accepting a blowjob and letting him fuck him…things have changed. The change in the little dude’s personality is pretty evident.  Although friendly enough before and certainly managing his alcoholism well enough to do well in his classes…he’s pretty much stopped drinking more than a couple of beers now, with an occasional shot now and then.  Since we fucked willingly while he was sober, the sex has continued. He’s gotten bold enough to come into my room in the middle of the night if he gets horny.  He still isn’t really comfortable enough to suck my cock yet, but he will stroke it while I’m eating his asshole and fingering him open to get him ready to take my cock.  I have to admit I love having him under me, legs spread wide and open and jacking his cock while I pound his asshole. He’s learned to hold off from popping his load until I let him know that I’m pretty close – he says it hurts to take it after he gets off, and he knows I won’t stop fucking him until I’m ready.  His asshole is now a full-fledged pussy now.  It opens so easy a little spit and shove will do – just the way I like it.  I consider it mine, and I remind him of it whenever I feel like when we’re alone – I slide my finger through his crack whenever I pass close by him. I have to admit I do miss the stealth fucking I laid on him while he was passed out, but I’m enjoying seeing him learn to accept how good it is to submit to another dude.  He’s expressed some interest in fucking me, but I think I prefer having him remain a bottom.  He helps himself to my toy collection, so think he’s ok with being the receiver.

I know this is wrong but I just cannot help it. Don’t get me wrong, I just stalked them, i don’t want to talk or meet or anything. Just plain stalking. I just want to know if this is considered cheating cause if it is, or if someone out there tells me that this is a form of cheating, then I’d like to look for answers to stop stalking my exes.", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  1)

Secret.create(id: 205636, content: "Tears rolled down my cheeks, I had finally let my dam of emotions go. I collapsed to my knees, screaming at the moon and ignored the pain I felt when my knees met the hardwood floor of the dock. Slowly but surely I felt my heart break into a million pieces. I was finally, properly  grieving my loss. It at fell down… my pride, my mask, my optimism, and my faith. I felt the lake water rock the deck gently. I opened my eyes and through my clouded vision, I saw my reflection in the water, My eyes were puffy, my face was red, and my hair was everywhere. When you lose someone the first thing is nothing. Your whole world is nothing, everything you had done in your life is nothing, you are nothing. It’s like for a whole second you are just an organism stuck to a rock, floating around a fireball at 67,000 mph, and that fireball will die out in 4.6 billion years, in the meantime it is spinning around a galaxy 100,000 light years long, and that galaxy is traveling around the entire universe. Then, when that second is over, you are hit by the freight train of reality. The one you have know for as long as you can remember is gone. You will never see them laugh again, or see them smile, hear them yell, or even see them cry. They are gone from existence and there is NOTHING you can do about it. My heart felt empty, it felt like it wasn’t even there, I forgot how to breathe, or how to even think. I can see myself, just an empty shell losing sanity. I have never in my life felt like this. The feeling of losing my mom is indescribable, even after experiencing all that, those words still can’t describe how I feel. I had been in Los Angeles, working as a game developer and game designer. It was around 2:37am when I had gotten the call from my step-brother. Mom had gone in and out of the hospital the last few months for various reasons. Vomiting, bleeding from her vaginal area, etc. She had gone into the hospital last week for blood in her vomit. She was suppose to be released tomorrow.  Jeff had called, I guess all of my other siblings had been in grief. I walked into my daughter Saphira’s room to wake her up. Saphira is 6 years old, I had packed her 2 bags and gave her, her iPad so she can stay awake while I packed my bags. I put all our stuff in the car and drove to my little sister’s house. It was early, I knocked and pounded on her door until she opened it, still in her pajamas. Then again it was 3 in the morning, I told Saphira to go into her tia’s room. “what do you want? It’s three in the morning-” my sister complained until she saw the tears streaming down my face. “Jelli what’s wrong? what happened?” I couldn’t speak, my mouth was open but no words came out. Darkness was surrounding me. No I thought Not now, I can’t do this right now. Stay strong, that’s what mom would have wanted “I-it’s mom…..-she’s gone…” the words barley slipped out. The color in my sisters face suddenly drained, then her breathing picked up speed. “No! NO! That can’t be true!!” she started to shout. I grabbed her and hugged her. She was ready to break and I wasn’t gonna let her lose herself to grief. She started to scream and cry. We both fell to our knees and she was just screaming and crying into my chest. Her husband Jake came to the door and asked what had happen. I simply said “my mom”. He dropped to his knees and caressed my sisters back. He helped me bring her inside and her daughter had woken up. Theodosia was about 4 years old. I got up and grabbed her and put her in my sisters bedroom with the TV on Disney channel and sat her next to Saphira. I came out of the room and seen my sister just cry to the moon. The tears just fell down my face, I made no sound. The crying had gone on for a while. When she was calm enough I told her to pack and we were headed to Austin. I had stayed with her while Jake packed for both of them and for their daughter. We got on the 8:40am flight from LAX to Austin nonstop. The entire flight I couldn’t help but to just see my mom’s smile, hear her laugh, listen to her horrible singing on road trips to California when I was a teenager. We arrived in Austin at 1:47pm. We rented a car for the whole trip and drove to my moms house. The entire drive we had sobbed and held hands. We arrived at home and we walked inside forgetting about our bags. Everyone was here, my sisters, brothers, my sister and brother-in-laws, cousins, nieces and nephews, my dad and my stepdad. We all hugged and cried. I walked outside onto the deck and just sat in the rocking chair and stared at the blue sky. I went on my phone and put on “I Can Only Imagine” By MercyMe. Suddenly I was taken back to when my tia Joann died back when I was 16. Mom was in the exact same spot I was in, In the rocking chair, staring into the sky, singing along to this song and crying. What seemed like forever the song finally changed. It changed to “Never Enough” by Loren Allred. It was a song from the musical The Greatest Showman. Soon enough my little sister came outside so we can all eat dinner. I turned off my music and walked inside. Mary decided to make mom’s favorite for dinner, Chicken and fideo . I went to say hi to my oldest Nieces Luna (11), Ivy (10), and Addison (9). They had been playing with their toys and tried to say hi to me and Anisa when we walked in. Luna had gotten really big since I’d seen her this past christmas, Saphira had been hungry and I got up to feed her some Ravioli that was in the pantry. I shakingly opened the can and made it in the microwave. Time seemed to go by very slow but also fast at the same time. Soon enough all of the kids fell asleep and we had all migrated outside drinking whatever we had in the pantry, I was on my 10th shot of Jack Daniels whiskey, I also was on my second glass of Captain Morgan and Dr. Pepper. “So when are they gonna take mom to the crematory?” I asked quietly. Lynn was the first to speak. “There gonna take her on Thursday, she’ll be ready Friday…” I nodded and we all started planning for her memorial. Mom always said she wanted to be cremated and not buried. She also wanted us to have a memorial just like Tia had. I also knew we needed to prep the house for everyone that’s gonna come. A massive family Vs. a 1,210 sqft. house. Yeah no this place will be a massive mess. We all also agreed that only immediate family is allowed to stay in the house, all of mom’s kids, sisters and mom. Also Lynn’s kids was allowed to stay too, considering they were my mom’s, husband’s, kids. Space was tight but no one complained, for me, staying in moms house right now is the best comfort. Of course Niecey, Mary, Raeann, and Adayos stayed at their own house since they all lived just under 5 minutes away from us. It was just me, my little sister, and all of my older brothers. We saved my old room for grandma and kid’s old room for tia Nene and tia Janette. I slept in the living room with my daughter and with puchee and her husband and kid. When everyone is asleep I felt someone shake my shoulder. I opened my eyes and saw saphira with her wide eye look. “Hey, what’s wrong honey” I instantly sat up and put her in my lap. “Where’s gamma?” My heart stopped, I hadn’t told her yet due to my grief. How can I be so stupid? I started to cry and just held my daughter close, god how I missed my mom, it felt like a hole burned into my soul. “Why are you crying mommy?” she asked very softly. I slowly picked up my head and wiped my tears. “Gamma went to heaven honey, and mommy is sad she left” My voice was shaky but strong. Saphira is a very smart child, the smartest in her class, but I don’t expect her to understand the situation. “Then why don’t we go see gamma in heaven?” she asked in a very innocent way. I laughed a little “Honey Heaven is a place we can’t go to yet, we have to wait to go to heaven.” I quietly explained to her, afraid to wake up my sister. “Is gamma coming back?” she asked. I just shook my head no. “I’m sorry honey, gamma won’t be coming back, but it’s going to be okay she will always watch over us”. After a while we both fell asleep. I had a dream I will never forget. I was at the Old Settlers Lake, the moon was full and glistening on the water. I was just walking and then I saw her, She was standing on the end of the dock. I screamed for her and ran into her arms. All she did was hold me and stroke my long dark brown hair. The last thing I remember was her saying, “It’s Going to be alright, I promise” Then she was gone, like mist disappearing after the sun arose for the day.", category: "a pain", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

I never looked at him in that way when I was younger, but because I was on the verge of becoming an adult, naturally I began to develop adult feelings. He is just such a down to earth guy. Down to earth guys are my absolute weakness, especially since they’re rare. He is also really funny, and I love a person with a good sense of humour.  We all do! And when we were alone, we would talk about deep things. I learned so much about him and he learned so much about me, and we became very good friends and still are. Naturally, we don’t talk as much as we used to. Then one day, I gave him my number to send me a picture of some work we were doing, and then we eventually began texting. He probably found me so annoying, but I know he definitely enjoyed the conversations we had, as did I. And sometimes I’d be at school in another class and be messaging him funny things, even though I knew it wasn’t that type of love, I finally felt one feeling I’ve never felt; a man love me. Even if it weren’t in the way that I had hoped. This brings me to my next point. During school and our time in school together, all I thought about was him and the way he was and the way he spoke about things and his values, his insights. I was so intrigued and interested in the man that he was. But I think, now that I have left school, never been in a romantic relationship or had the types of experiences that my friends have had, I guess I just crave being loved. Sometimes I have dreams and random thoughts of him and me; but to be honest, they’re more about him looking at me, and the way he sees me. I have dreams of him walking in on me playing piano and him just falling in love with the way I press the keys, I dream of him seeing me in a nice outfit and because the dream seems so real, I find myself craving that moment when I actually felt attracted to. Sometimes I think that maybe I don’t love him anymore, but I love the way he made me feel and the way he did care for me. Even if it was just because he knew he had to. And even if he treated other people similarly, it didn’t matter. He made me feel as loved as I have ever felt, even though he wasn’t even trying. What do I do?", category: "a truth", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 205456, content: "Sweden’s Population replacement is in full swing. One in four students has a Muslim migrant background. Still the tax-funded state television (SVT) is upset that there is an uneven distribution of Muslim students. Schools are insufficiently mixed, they claim.  There are several schools with over 90 percent Muslim students, while others only have around five percent. There are “many” such examples across the country, and the authorities therefore try to force multiculturalism upon the schools.  SVT emphasizes that it is “problematic for several reasons that students with different backgrounds meet less and less often in school”.  (It seems that the Muslims don’t want to “meet” Swedish students.) “We have an increased concentration of students based on social background and migration background (that means Muslims schools exclusively for Muslims) and as a result we have increased differences in school results”, says Peter Fredriksson, Director-General of the Swedish National Agency for Education, in a comment to SVT News.  Some students are smarter and perform better than others, which is alarming to Peter Fredriksson, who wants everyone to be equally dim witted. The municipalities are now doing everything possible to mix up the schools. Which includes closing schools, placing new schools more centrally, merging smaller schools into larger ones, and changing the classification so that students end up in the same schools regardless of where they reside.  Some students must make long and tiresome trips to get to their new school all for the sake of “diversity”.", category: "a fantasy", likes:  1, dislikes:  2)

I love you.” His mom, dad, and sister all abandoned him. He was abandoned by previous loves. He was anally raped in prison. I hope we have a bright future together.

Then someone else came out of the bathroom, completely nude and dripping wet with a towel on her head. It was very likely her daughter – as she was also blonde with similar features. She was probably about 14 to 16 (I know, horrible, but beauty is beauty – I just saw two beautiful, fully developed women). I watched mother and daughter standing there naked in their hotel room together. One of them dripping wet. They exchanged a couple words and made each other laugh. I was awestruck. I just stood there outside in the dark summer air and jerked myself off to completion in my pants while watching them.

He beat me with leather belts and shoes really bad over stupid stuff, He also beat my sister brother and mother on the daily… And he made us clean and scrub all day While he sat down and drank beer all day,made us do military exercise and if we quit would beat the crap out of us too, He didn’t even have a job maybe one or two for a short spell.. He used to try and pay me for sex when I was about 9 Y/O and every time I would say no he would put his price up( “how about 30 How about 100”?) When nobody was around in the daytime and we were sitting in the livingroom,he had his zipper down let his dick out then ask me to look at him, Every mountain bike I got for my birthday which was my only source of joy he would take them out ride them until they broke never to buy another one and he would do this every birthday,  He never had any empathy for anybody but him.My mother didn’t call the police and threatened me not to call. She plays victim and acts like she didn’t hear daily beating. After his did all of this(That’s not all he has done) He told me I will never feel as much pain as him.. Now that I’m a mother I find that sometimes I get too aggressive with my daughter and i cant calm my rage when she acts disrespectful or acts up at school.I get afraid that I might hurt her, but when she good I’m always a loving mother. I’ve  had enjoying thoughts about killing him over and over again, and I’ve also had enjoying thoughts about going on a spree and killing other abusive fathers and husbands, If I kill one would I feel satisfied? I think if I killed one that would just make me feel better for one day.. Kidnapping one and holding him in my basement just to torment would give me a great sense of satisfaction.

Including the classic “well, your partner is very lucky” aka ‘if you were single, I’d like to date you’ During a game of truth or dare at a cast party I was asked who in the room I’d like to have sex with. I answered that I’d like to have sex with the director and one of the actors as a close second. The director wasn’t paying attention when I said that, but a few minutes later someone informed her of my answer and she seemed quite happy with it. Her boyfriend was there also and said something like “should I be jealous” and I said “if you want to be” All this to say that I’ve been thinking about kissing her and maybe having sex. She’s hot, she’s very capable, I like women in charge, etc etc. Her boyfriend appears to be kinda lame and incompatible with her, so it would feel great to show her there are better options. But, in real life I’m staying in my relationship and I don’t think it’s nice to rag on other people’s boyfriends.

It also allowed me to explore some things that I had always wondered what the big deal was, within the limits of what I could explore alone or occasionally with someone.  Some of those experiences/experiments were meh…..”ok I guess I get it”.  Others hit me far harder than I would have ever expected.  One of those things?  Diaper wearing (for bladder purposes only).  The first time i deliberately wet myself in a diaper I felt so utterly ashamed and ridiculous, and had to drive myself to the point of very desperate need, to total loss of control.  Actually tried running for the bathroom at the last second.  And I learned the warm wet slightly sticky sensation as I wet the diaper to be nothing short of exhilirating and breath-taking.  I was hooked hard.  Began deliberately soaking diapers.  Inserting pads so they held more.  Not only eventually training myself to never use a bathroom for urination, to go as needed comfortably and enjoyably.  Never masturbated, it was completely asexual to my surprise.  It was all about the sensation of wet and warmth and being able to go when I wanted to.  Eventually I started wearing diapers (cloth and disposable) on a 24/7 basis.  At work, out socially, overnight.  Got hooked on the constant wet heavy soggy feel.  The amount of time it took to genuinely lose all bladder control entirely was shockingly short.  It took several months to get bladder control back.", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

All of us noticed and stifled cruel smirks– especially his coworker who was uncontrollably doing double-takes. No one told him. He was young and mildly attractive so I suppose none of us wanted to spoil the show. I was the last of a long line, and when I got to his counter, (which was just below crotch-level) I found that I had an unblemished view. I had also just done some research about the prices of my books in line and found that they were far cheaper on amazon. So I explained to my cashier that I was having second thoughts and that I wanted to take a picture of my books on his counter to remind myself later. He seemed to think this was perfectly reasonable and stood there as I actually snapped pictures of his brightly-colored bulge. I’m sure that my camera angle looked suspicious, especially because I was probably smiling like a total bitch while taking the photos. His coworker was too– she covered her mouth and shot a knowing look my way. The poor guy was none the wiser, however, and we exchanged parting pleasantries as I took my leave.

Secret.create(id: 204628, content: "People are too lazy to do research and they WANT to believe the comfortable lies.  That’s why we live in a country of stupidity and ignorance. There were only a few large farms, called plantations, which required slaves due to the labor intensive work. You had to be WEALTHY to afford to live on a plantation or to own slaves. That sure wasn’t most folks. So slavery, which was being phased out due to mechanization, was NOT the Southern way of life. A few thousand owned slaves. That’s not many people out of an entire nation. People in the North had no plantations, as the growing season is too short. Yet ALL white people are condemned for slavery, merely because they are white. That is stupid and irrational thinking. It was white people in the North who operated the underground railway to free black people. So why don’t you thank the white people? And the vast majority of the whites of the South did NOT own slaves. Many white people immigrated to this country AFTER slavery ended. So how can they be responsible when they didn’t get here until after it was over? But the final touch is that not one, no not even one white person alive today is responsible for slavery – because NONE of them were alive way back then and so not one of them owned a slave. Yet we denigrate the whites for slavery, that they had NOTHING to do with. Slavery ENDED in 1865. That was a long time ago. No one alive today was alive back then. All the people from back then are dead. So you will need to divert your hatred to the white people of today, who NEVER owned a slave. Blacks should stop dwelling in the past and try living today. Slavery is LONG since over. You are not a slave and you NEVER have been one. Whites don’t owe us a damn thing! And yes I am black. We have black mayors, black police officers, black Congressmen, black fire fighters, black movie stars, black sports stars, and even a black President. If you are black you can be anything you want to be. Or sit on your ass (and blame the white people) and be nothing. It takes effort to get off your ass and do something positive. But lots of blacks have done it. Blaming others is just an excuse for being lazy. Filling yourself with hate doesn’t leave any room for accomplishment. Get the past out of your way. It’s over. You can’t change it. But you can improve today. You can build a foundation for a better tomorrow. Take responsibility for yourself.", category: "a truth", likes:  5, dislikes:  1)

All across America there are homeless people. The homeless lack shelter, food, medical care, income and even water. (The California governor now wants to tax drinking water.) There are homeless advocacy projects to try to help, but they lack funding. Despite this situation, some people fail to see any problem in mass or illegal immigration. They claim that everyone should be allowed into the country. Free health care for all, including for everyone from every nation in the world. Who will pay for this free health care, free food, free housing, free education, free transportation, free clothing, free entertainment, free everything? Where will the money come from? No wonder the California governor wants to tax drinking water. His state is one of the hardest hit by illegal immigrants. Hospitals in Texas, Nevada, California, and other states have closed from bankruptcy because they must treat illegal immigrants who don’t pay. Now those hospitals don’t serve anyone. When a nation can’t take care of the people it already has, then should it import more people? Should it import people who can’t speak English; who have no skills; who are carrying and spreading diseases, and who have sworn to destroy America? Have you seen the gumball explanation on YouTube.

That way JEWS will rule the world. (We Jews have a high IQ). It’s called the Kalergi plan. But you are probably too stupid to look it up on Google and read about it yourself.

Some music is timeless, sometimes it can really suck too, but for the most part everyone has different tastes and it’s all irrelevant in the big picture.

It means we’re advancing technologically and you assholes wouldn’t have facebook and instagram to complain about how our childhoods suck because of technology if computers and smartphones were never invented in the first place. We still play outside just like you, maybe we play video games and post to social media too, but so what? you guys do it too. Also, most of us aren’t what you think we are. We don’t go to parties every night and spend every waking moment getting stoned and having sex. Have you even heard of high school? We have way too much homework to actually have time to do anything but go to school and sleep(we don’t even get enough sleep).

There is this woman who I’ve become very good friends with. She’s 36, has a masters’ degree, 5’9 and a half and 160 lbs. She’s got short dark hair, big brown eyes, small tits a round firm curvy ass, she’s  big boned but very toned and she runs marathons. the only thing is she’s not interested in me (she knows I’m very interested)- I’m a tall 6’2″ college educated professional a big guy, a little overweight (about 250 lbs) but that’s why I’m not looking for someone who is 5 feet tall and 90 lbs. Last night we were hanging out and we went back to my apartment. I thought things were going to happen. My roommate was home. I didn’t think anything of it though. He’s 21 years old, about the same height I am. He’s thin – maybe 160 lbs and although he ran track in high school I just consider himself skinny. He never went to college and works odd construction jobs and as a waiter too at a hip trendy restaurant downtown. So we’re all hanging out talking, I go to use the bathroom (way too much beer) I go back into the living room and they’re both in his bedroom. He’s banging the shit out of her all night. All I can hear are her moans and screams. They wake up this morning and he’s fucking her in the shower. They both went for a run this morning and haven’t been back. I just want to kick the shit out of my roommate when he gets back but then I’m wondering what if he ends up kicking the shit out of me. I’m so fucking besides my self right now.

And if I have to speak for myself, I wouldn’t fuckin hesitate to end my life in the blink of an eye. I just don’t want my parents to feel sad. And we have this university enterance exam that seniors and grads take every year, that exam fucks up all the students’ life and psychology in our country. Like there are so many young People in thir early 20’s that killed themselves after it. The most idiotic education system ever. Anyway, so it happened last year. Me and my friends were gonna take that big exam in less than 2 months. People were starting to get tense. There was a girl in my friend group, who couldn’t seem to get her grades up, it was like she knew she was gonna suck. This one day, a guy in our friend group suggested to go to a bar that Friday night to cool up. Every one thought it was a good idea so we did. We drank, got drunk, had conversations, made out with eachother a little, danced, etc… As the bar tender was preparing to close the place, it was just me, that sad girl, and another dude from our friend group. We started talking about some real deep and philosophical shit. And that moment was the first time i came clean about the personal reasons of why i wanted to kill myself. I didn’t know when to stop. I kept pointing out clever reasons to do it. The other guy tried to shut me up but i went on. She was listening very carefully. Eventually the guy started to get pissed and stormed off. We kept talking during our way to home. Two days later, we heard that she had killed herself. Hung herself over the ceiling in her room, possibly when she was home alone. When i heard the news, all i could think of was that night, what i said to her. I heard my voice’s echo in my head and i could imagine her face listening to me carefully. When we heard the news, my angry friend who was with us at the end of the night, looked at me, gave me small glance as he knew this was gonna happen. I failed the exam that year, i sucked.

Secret.create(id: 204320, content: "I don’t like I’m worth anything unless a man is using my anus for his pleasure.  It doesn’t matter if I cum, although I often do (forced to by the act of being penetrated). I was taught to wait for him face down and ass up.  I don’t consider myself an attractive person, but that doesn’t matter anyway. He only cares than I am clean, so i am freshly showered.  My asshole is thoroughly douched. I bury my face in the pillow when he comes into the room unless it’s dark and it makes it unnecessary. i listen to him undress and my asshole quivers.  I hear him open the lube and enjoy the wet sounds.  I know he’s lubing his cock and getting himself hard. He joins me on the bed and cups my ass cheeks.  I hear the squirts and squelch as he squeezes lube onto my asshole. Sometimes he will finger my asshole a little before propping this head of his cock against the hole. The anticipation is intense.  Will he plunge his entire cock into me all at once?  Will he fuck it into me a little at a time?  My hole loves it when he opens me as he goes int a little at a time, but what I want is never considered.  Only his desire matters. He pushes in all at once. I involuntarily try to escape his cock, but he grabs my shoulder and hip and holds me, forcing his cock into me full length.  Despite the gasps and moans of pain while he penetrates me this way, he knows I am grateful for his cock  and for holding me and forcing me to take it. He holds me still until I settle and my asshole relaxes at the penetration.  I’m only aware of his.  The world has faded away.  There is nothing but his large cock filling and spread my asshole open, his strong hands holding me, and his breath on my neck. I moan as he drags his cock out of me.  It feels like he’s pulling my hole inside out and the world ends when my hole is empty.  He loves pulling out of me, waiting a second or two, then plunging back in.  He continues to do this until my sphincter is exhausted and can no longer fight back. I enjoy the sounds.  Wet sounds, rude sounds, embarrassing sounds as he brutalizes my hole with his fuck.  I love his strength and appreciate his deep grunts and moans and focused deep breaths.  He takes his time.  He does what feels good to him. He pulls out of my hole occasionally and fingers the opening, checking to see how loose I’m getting. He loves making me big.  The fucking continues as long as he wants it.  Hard, fast, slow, deep, sometimes just plunging the fat head of his cock into and out of my sphincter before slamming the length of his big cock back into me and pounding again. I know he’s ready to cum when he becomes gentle.  The weight of his larger body is bearing down on me, his head resting on mine, his large cock slowly withdrawing until just the head remains before pushing slowly back in to me, grinding and pressing me down into the mattress. He tells me to tighten up, and I squeeze his cock with my asshole as tightly as I can. His body is rigid on top of me when I feel his cock thicken even more.  He groans in my ear when he begins to cum and I am honored as his cock begins to flex in my hole while I grip it desperately with my asshole.  I imagine the jets of his thick white cum shooting in my asshole.  He humps a little while he finishes, letting my asshole milk every drop it can. He lifts his weight from me while his cock remains for a moment before he pulls it out, making me feel empty but seeded while his cum.  He slips several fingers into my exhausted cunt and pats me on the ass.  Good boy, he says. I remain on the bed in my submissive position, listening to him wash the fuck off of himself before he goes back to work or to his wife and baby.  I quiver involuntarily and my asshole is clenching and relaxing, very wet.  I hump the bed when he returns and gets dressed.  I hear his cellphone snap a few pictures but don’t mind. It’s very quiet after the hotel door slams shut.  I remain there a few minutes, marinating in lube and cum and his masculine sweat, my hole aching and burning from the fuck.

Secret.create(id: 204227, content: "Over 30 years ago I told a guy in my Southy neighborhood that he needed to talk to his little sister about hanging out with two these brothers who were notorious bullies and braggarts. They were known for tag teaming girls and I didn’t want to see his sister subjected to such gossip because I had a crush on her. Anyway, a few weeks later both Brothers were shot to death execution style in the park late at night and no one knew who did it. It turned out one of the brothers was her boyfriend and a few months later she had a kid for him. A few years ago the same guy I told about his sister was indicated for a bunch of kills, but the case against him was dropped. I didn’t know this at the time I went to him about his sister but he was a professional hitman. I’ve since moved from Boston and relocated to Canada were I live with my wife and our 2 children. Last week the younger sister who still looks beautiful showed up at my house with a duffle bag. She didn’t say a fucking word to me. She just looked at me very cold like she wanted to kill me, dropped the duffle bag on my doorstep and then got back in her car and drove off. I was so scared to open the duffle bag, I thought it was going to be the limbs of my children, or the severed head of my wife but it turned out to be 1.7 million dollars in U.S. Dollars with a unsigned thank you card. The duffle bag with the money is hidden in my garage and I haven’t told my wife anything about it, because there’s another part of the story I didn’t say until now. The two brothers who I told the guy about were her 1st Cousins. I didn’t know the guy was a killer, and I didn’t find out she was related to the brothers until a few years after we were married. My wife doesn’t know these guys as neighborhood bad guys like I knew them to be, she just know them as her cousins who she loved and cared for, and now I know for sure that it was my big jealousy filled mouth that got them killed. There’s hush money in my garage and I don’t want to have anything to do with it. A known murderer knows exactly where I live in a neighboring country and I’m married to a wonderful woman who I don’t believe will ever forgive me if she ever found out were this money came from.

Secret.create(id: 204163, content: "So, gay dude here who began molesting my blackout drunk college roomie back in the fall term, sucking his cock and licking and fingering his asshole, and finally working up to fingerfucking his hole to train him to take my cock.  I began fucking him in the spring term, and eventually arranged for a bud to fuck him also – although that turned out differently than expected.  My bud actually talked him into letting him blow him, rim him, and even fucked him – true, roomie was drunk still, but awake for the fucking this time. He worried me a little after that, being too quiet and not drinking.  I finally brought up the fucking since I’d been there to witness it.  He admitted he liked it more than he thought he was and was also a little ashamed of it and afraid it would get out.  I assured him it was no one’s business and I’d never tell, and agreeing if he wanted to explore more I’d be willing to do that with him. Well, nothing for several days.  He still wasn’t drinking enough to black out and I don’t mind telling you I was getting pretty fucking antsy wanting to fuck that pussy I built.  I even got pretty drunk myself one night hoping he would give in and join me.  He had a few beers but went to bed on his own. Last night I decided that it had gone too far, maybe.  Having my bud fuck him when he was awake and enjoying it might have messed things up to the point where he blamed alcohol for the gay sex, and the guilt for enjoying it.  So, I decided..fuck it…I have GOT to get this load off before my balls explode. After he went to bed I finished up some reading and went to my bedroom, too.  I’ve got a 32″ tv with an apple TV and decided to airplay some good rough gay porn.  I’m kinda been addicted with anonymous sex vids that a lot of guys post – especially the kind where they are sorta waiting on hands and knees for some dude to just walk in and fuck them.  I stripped naked and was purusing vids, watchin some good fucks, tugging my meat pretty good.  I’m so horned my nuts are fucking drawn up to my dick, and I’m gooning over it.  I’ve actually filmed myself when I get in these moods and it’s fucking hilarious seeing myself zone out working my dick. I’d been edging a good 15 mins or so when my door opened.  Nothing I could do.  Roomie apologized and started to leave but I told him it was cool..just let me put some shorts on.  He said nah, carry on…I thought that was what you were doing and told me he was pretty horned himself.  Told him he could join me if he wanted and jack off together or whatever… So we did.  I even pulled up some straight shit because I wanted to really rev him up, and it worked.  We chatted too about what we liked and what we thought was hot, etc.  He gets comfortable enough to take his shorts off and strokes himself.  His cock is a little bigger and thicker than mine, and I take the opportunity to compliment him on it.  He’s a short skinny fucker, so his above avg dick looks even bigger.  I’m careful not to mention that I’ve tasted his dick, balls, ass, and cum already on multiple occasions, but this is going well and I probably won’t ever tell him that anyway. Getting froggy and hoping he’ll be comfortable enough to do more, I pull out a buttplug from a drawer and some lube, and ask him if he minds if I pop it in.  I’m mostly a top but when I’m this gooned out I like a little assplay.  He says he doesn’t mind and I notice him watching VERY intently as I raise my legs in bed and start lubing my hole up, then the plug, and start fucking it into me a little at a time.  Finally it slides in and I’m sure to moan and groan, keeping my legs raised and stroking my cock while my asshole is clenching and relaxing. We watch some more porn, swapping between gay and straight stuff.  He keeps his eye on the screen while we’re watching straight porn, but studies me while I’m watching the gay stuff.  I make sure to pull the plug out of myself and pop it back in when I know he’s watching.  His dick is fucking rigid. I ask him if he’s ever played with another dudes cock before and he says no.  I ask him to help me out and stroke my cock a little if he’s comfortable.  He gets quiet but comes and joins me on the bed.  He finally takes my dick in his hand and strokes it for me.  I lay back and enjoy it, moaning.  I also grab my nipples and twist and tug those.  He looks at the screen but back to my dick for awhile.  I put one hand on his back while he’s working. I’m getting too close, though.  I want to nut bad, but want him in need.  Told him to lay down.  While he finds some straight porn, I go for his cock with my mouth and suck…massaging and tugging his balls.  He’s into it and gets to moaning good, so I take the opportunity to raise his legs.  He resists and tries to discourage me, but I know this dude loves hole work by now.  Soon, I’m licking and sucking on his asshole which I know so well so far.  He gets into that pretty quick and doesn’t object when I start working a couple of fingers into him.  Fuck, that hole clamping down on my fingers…I missed it bad. While I finger his hole I go back to sucking on his cock, keeping it hard and rigid.  Love how his asshole reacts to the sucking…almost feels like it’s sucking on my fingers in thanks.  He’s too close, too.  And I want inside his pussy.  Without asking permission I get up and get between his legs, spit on my cock, and prop my head against his asshole.  He’s looking at me worried but I ignore it and start pumping it into him.  I didn’t want to give him a chance to ask me to put on a rubber and ruin the mood. I have one leg raised high, one hand stroking his hardon, and my cock pumping its way into his snug wet pussy.  He isn’t blacked out.  He hasn’t even had more than a couple of beers today.  This is all him, taking my dick willingly, raw, and wide awake.  I’ve trained his pussy to take cock pretty well by now, and my bud has already fucked him pretty hard, so I’m pounding him.  I love how small this little dude is under me. He gets loud, but I don’t care.  I’m railing him.  I’m telling him how much I love fucking his hot hole and how hot he looks under me, and how awesome his hard cock is letting me know he is loving my dick breeding him.  He’s not talking, just making these animal noises while I ream him out.  It doesn’t matter if he’s sore now.  He knows he’s being fucked.  His dick is rigid and flexing in my hand while my dick is plugging his asshole. He starts saying “cum.”  He just repeats it over and over.  “Cum.  Please cum.”  I finally start to understand that he wants ME to cum so I will stop..haha…but no.  I tell him no, I won’t cum.  I’m gonna keep pounding his ass until HE cums, and he is gonna cum with my dick in his asshole.  He finally gives in and goes pretty limp…submitting…letting me dominate him.  I start jacking his cock hard and slow down my pace…dragging my dick out and sliding it back in.  I knew his hole well enough to know he was about to pop, and as lifeless as he was I was very familiar having usually fucked him while he was blacked out. FINALLY, he starts moaning and it sounds like he’s almost in pain…his dick thickens and swells…and he starts squirting jizz all over himself.  I bury my dick deep to enjoy his asshole clenching and relaxing around my cock while he nuts.  Once he calms down I begin to pump again, and he starts to protest – some dudes can’t handle being fucked after they cum. I’m close though and just tell him to hold on.  I fuck slow and his ass has tighted up a lot, fighting it now.  I drag my dick out to just the opening before pushing it back in.  His hands are on my shoulders and chests now and he’s grimacing..it’s sexy seeing him struggle while my cock reams him.  I can’t hold it any more and bury it balls deep…pushing him down into the bed.  I start to cum, and I know he HAS to feel my dick flexing while I cum inside him. I stay inside him until I’m soft enough for his asshole to push me out, then collapse on the bed beside him.  Without thinking too much about it, I pull the buttplug out of my and insert it into him.  It goes in without a fight, and we both laugh.  We don’t say much, but giggle now and then while we recover.  He finally gets up and says he needs to go shower, so I tell him goodnight and that I had a great time.  He laughs again and leaves. I went to sleep covered him our juice. I’m wondering now if he’s ever gonna black out again.  As fun as this is becoming, I miss using him without his consent.", category: "a guilt", likes:  7, dislikes:  3)

I havent been able to love myself fully including my face shape, eyebrows, body and even personality. I try to hide my insecurities from other people acting like i dont care. But i do care about it, a lot. I have tried to be better, how to be beautiful and enjoy life at the same time. I hate everything about me. Theres nth to love and i absolutely have no talents. Other people seems to be more beautiful, more pretty and outgoing than me. I have no confidence in life. Right now i dont even post my pictures on social media anymore since am so afraid of the judgement and especially how people will think they r better than me. I have three best-friends whom i dont feel close at all. I dont pour my feeling to those people. And when i do, two of them will say some soothing words that dont mean anything to me and other one will tease and try to bring me down or thats what i think he/she is trying to do. Its so hard to be myself. Being a teenager is not easy, there are a lot of stress to deal with such as schools, friends and family. When i was a kid, no one liked me so i had lied to myself that am not ugly, that i am better than them in any other way possible. In reality, i am not. And its time to accept the reality, i am not good in anything, i am not pretty, i am just a loser who suck at life and who cant even speak properly. I stutter most of the time and whenever i speak, i feel abnormal because a lot of people look at me weirdly and i kinda become quiet. I was not a strong kid, i was so sensitive and cried every time. Theres no strong bone in me but i am always proud of myself that i am able to hide these insecurities away. This note might be edgy but its hard to deal with all the negativity i have received through the society and the one i have infested in myself.

Now, she’s married, I’m single, and thoroughly in her shoes from our college days. I love her dearly. But I won’t fuck it up.

Now that I have a new job as a supervisor and I feel happy and am successful, he suddenly feels lonely and his feelings of being lonely (as he has said) are “different and more valid” than mine. He already expects me to help babysit, financially support, take care of his adopted daughter; he expects me to be there to alter my work schedule to help him with childcare each week when his retail work schedule changes suddenly; he expects me to emotionally fulfill him. But he doesn’t do any of the same for me. He won’t clear his schedule to help me in moments of need (apparently his work is more important than mine). I’ve paid for $10,000 of his debts and problems and he doesn’t pay a dime for anything of mine or to help me. Mind you, I make significantly less money than him. There is no reciprocity emotionally, financially, or effort wise. When I brought up how he’s being unreasonable in demanding all of the above and more and then it is ridiculous that he comes to me to make me responsible for his feelings of loneliness, his response was (once again) “Welcome to adulthood. How do you think other couples make it work? All my friend’s wives sacrifice so their men can be successful. I don’t care about your loneliness, it’s different from mine and my needs have to be met.” I hate him.", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

At 10, I had an examination where we were told they were in fact nipples. I was kind of scared, but the doctors were unsure whether or not there was going to be any extra breast tissue with the nipples in the future. When I was 11, my normal breasts were almost B-cups, and at this point, the two other ‘breasts’ had been growing for some time tool, becoming a slightly raised area around the extra nipples. Now that I’m 14, I have a pair of D-cups with a pair of C-cups right below them. All breasts and nipples are properly shaped and look like normal. I wear a regular bra and a smaller, strapless bra below it when I’m at school and in public or with friends, and most of my friends know about my condition, and are very accepting.

Secret.create(id: 203831, content: "We live in a country of stupidity and ignorance. People are too lazy to do research about Lincoln and they WANT to believe the comfortable lies. There were only a few large farms, called plantations, which required slaves due to the labor intensive work. You had to be WEALTHY to afford to live on a plantation or to own slaves.  That sure wasn’t most folks. So slavery, which was being phased out due to mechanization, was NOT the Southern way of life. A few thousand owned slaves.  That’s not many people out of an entire nation. People in the North had no plantations, as the growing season is too short. Yet ALL white people are condemned for slavery, merely because they are white.  That is stupid and irrational thinking. It was white people in the North who operated the underground railway to free black people. So why don’t you thank the white people? And the vast majority of the whites of the South did NOT own slaves. Many white people immigrated to this country AFTER slavery ended. So how can they be responsible when they didn’t get here until after it was over? But the final touch is that not one, no not even one, white person alive today is responsible for slavery – because NONE of them were alive way back then and not one of them owned a slave. Yet we denigrate the whites for slavery, that they had NOTHING to do with. Slavery ENDED in 1865. That was a long time ago. No one alive today was alive back then. All the people from back then are dead. So you will need to divert your hatred to the white people of today, who NEVER owned a slave. Blacks should stop dwelling in the past and try living today. Slavery is LONG since over.  You are not a slave and you NEVER have been one. Whites don’t owe us a damn thing! And yes I am black. We have black mayors, black police officers, black Congressmen, black fire fighters, black movie stars, black sports stars, and even a black President.  If you are black you can be anything you want to be.  Or sit on your ass (and blame the white people) and be nothing.  It takes effort to get off your ass and do something positive.  But lots of blacks have done it.  Blaming others is just an excuse for being lazy.  Filling yourself with hate doesn’t leave any room for accomplishment. Get the past out of your way.  It’s over.  You can’t change it.  But you can improve today.  You can build a foundation for a better tomorrow. Take responsibility for yourself.", category: "a wild experience", likes:  3, dislikes:  2)

Thousands of people are without homes, running water, or medical care in Hawaii.  One large homeless camp is just below the rim of one of Hawaii’s elite golf courses. In some cold weather locations, homeless people freeze to death.  Even in Atlanta there have been deaths from freezing. America is one of the world’s richest nations. All across America there are homeless people.  The homeless lack shelter, food, medical care, income and even water.  (The California governor now wants to tax drinking water.) There are homeless advocacy projects to try to help, but they lack funding. Despite this situation, some people fail to see any problem in mass or illegal immigration.  They claim that everyone should be allowed into the country.  Free health care for all, including for everyone from every nation in the world.  Who will pay for this free health care, free food, free housing, free education, free transportation, free clothing, free entertainment, free everything?  Where will the money come from?  No wonder the California governor wants to tax drinking water.  His state is one of the hardest hit by illegal immigrants. Hospitals in Texas, Nevada, California, and other states have closed from bankruptcy because they must treat illegal immigrants who don’t pay.  Now those hospitals don’t serve anyone.  When a nation can’t take care of the people it already has, then should it import more people?  Should it import people who can’t speak English; who have no skills; who are carrying and spreading diseases, and who have sworn to destroy America? Have you seen the gumball explanation on YouTube.

Surely, many people have been through worse than I did, so I probably don’t even have the right to say that I’ve been through a lot. Yet, I wonder why I put on a show for everyone. On the outside, I’m probably a star student who seems to have the perfect life. Teacher’s favorite. Plenty of extracurricular activities outside of school hours. But it’s just ironic how I give advice to those who are “depressed” and “extremely sad”, yet, I dismiss the fact that I secretly hate myself too. Sorry, I shouldn’t be whining like this. I can’t be weak like this. I don’t want to seem so… breakable in front of you. But I just can’t f—ing help it right now. After all, I’m not as strong as you think I am. Not even close. I just don’t want others to see me cry. I don’t want you to worry about me–my emotions should never be a burden for you. And so I hid everything. From everyone. I hid the fact that I’m too critical of my own flaws. I forced myself to look happy so that others don’t stare at me and question what’s wrong. It’s not a bad thing, right? When I needed to smile, I smiled. My underclassmen looked up to me as someone they always get help from. I was so careful around their problems that I tend to dismiss my own. I’m probably that disgustingly positive girl who says optimistic stuff all the time. Then I just overwork myself to live up to the standard. To them, I’m probably the least expected person to be secretly hateful of herself. Lately, I reflected upon my actions and realized that I’m so fake. I’m so f—ing fake. I’ve worked so hard in my past years to build a good resume, but so what? I’m so tired of trying to prove myself just to give my family bragging rights. My parents were proud of my academic records, so I just kept pushing myself to be the best. I did it because it made them happy. Even if it was at the expense of my own happiness. I feel empty at the praises that others give me as I receive certificate after certificate. They don’t know me at all. Hah, I probably sound so stupid right now though. So unlike the me that others are used to. I can’t accept the fact that I’m slowly stepping towards depression. I shouldn’t be thinking this way. I just can’t do anything about it.

As you know, the roomie got openly and thoroughly fucked by a bud of mine over the weekend.  Yes, he was still pretty drunk but not unconscious – he was fully aware of what was happening to him.  Yes, I still fucked him also later on when he did get around to blacking out. He was pretty quiet for a few days after that, and also wasn’t drinking much either.  He didn’t seem depressed or anything, just uncharacteristically quiet.  Last night I finally decided I needed to broach the subject with him.  We were both in our seperate rooms studying, but I came out about 11 to get something to drink and saw him in bed reading.  I asked if he’d like something and he asked for a beer.  I brought us both back one and invited myself to sit and talk. I told him I was a little worried about what had happened with my friend at the party on the lake and wanted to check on him.  I was there, after all, and watched the fucking occur.  He told me he was pretty embarrassed about it and hoped that I wouldn’t spread it around.  He also confessed that he liked it a lot more than he thought he would have, but it was kind of fuzzy and dreamlike.  He remembered it happened, but was a little disconnected from it, too. I assured him it was no one’s business and since my friend was rarely around and didn’t go to the same school, he had no worries there either.  I asked him if he thought he might be interested in exploring it more.  He was a little hesitant, but said in the right situation he thought he might.  We talked a lot about gay sex, sucking, fucking, rimming, and other stuff and I was squirming.  He seemed to be ok with things being done TO him, but squeamish about doing things in return. Most of all, he seemed surprised about not being sore after taking a fuck under my friend – I didn’t tell him his hole had been in training for quite awhile.  The conversation ended with him agreeing that if he was up for exploring gay sex with someone, we’d do it together and keep it on the downlow.  Tonight, we’re gonna watch some gay porn and maybe try some stuff that excites him. You may think I’ll stop fucking him when he blacks out, but I won’t.

Secret.create(id: 203466, content: "When I was little, about age 4-6, me and my cousin would catch baby birds. We tried to take car of them. At one point though I wondered what would happen if I squeezed one. My cousin was inside doing something so I thought id test and see what happens. So I squeezed it. At first the bird was confused. I squeezed it harder and it started to squirm and tweet in pain. I learned that the harder I squeezed them the more they would react, so I continued to squeeze it and I felt… Happy… Pleasure… Satisfaction..?  God I dont know what it was but something about it… I just loved it. I think I even giggled a little. I gave it one last squeeze and I heard a snap. The bird shot its head up as blood poured out of its little lungs. The blood got all over my hands and I was kinda shocked. I dropped the bird and looked around quickly. I knew that playing with the birds was bad but I knew murdering them was definitely bad. I went over to this old well in my grandmothers back yard, tossed it in and wiped my hand on my overalls repeatedly. I was sad that I killed the bird but I think it was more that my fun had to end so soon. When my cousin came back outside he asked me where the bird went. I told him it flew away. He was disappointed and we continued the day like normal. That was my first kill. Ever sense iv found some kind of enjoyment in torturing animals. I rarely do it now and its turned into just loving them and laughing when they get scared by something followed with calming pets. Of course my desire hasnt gone away. Iv just learned how to bottle it up. God I really want to do it again and remember how it felt. My baby bird count is I think 4-5. I also learned that my grandfather found the birds bodys and threw them away. I guess it was just curiosity that tainted the cat… Or blessed it… Heh… Im so sick…", category: "a guilt", likes:  0, dislikes:  2)

Fetishes have always been for kinky people and not me. It started at work. I was in the office alone and I put binder clips on my nipples. I walked around topless like that and did my work as the aching increased. When I took them off I had a feeling of euphoria. I thought it was a one off thing and put it to the back of my mind. I didn’t have an opportunity to do it again for a while and when I was alone in the office I did it again but this time I also put them on my labia. God, that hurt, a lot. I forced myself to work with them on and I loved the intense feeling after taking them off. I started to think about it even when I wasn’t able to do it and longed for opportunities to do it. Each time the opportunity arouse I’d do as much as I could. I even started to paddle myself with rulers, putting thumb tacks in my bra and panties. I feel guilty leading this secret life of self imposed pain but what really scares me that I want to do more. I am having fantasias of being tied up and spanked but I can’t cheat on my husband.

I used the downstairs restroom to try to keep away from them, but they came in while I was there.  I was alone with only them.  They started pushing me around.  They pushed me down on my knees and forced me to give one of them a blowjob.  He dumped a thick load in my mouth and made me open my mouth to show it to him, before he ordered me to swallow it.  I was gagging on it and they were laughing. Then the other one made me give him a blow job too. He made me swallow it down and then display an empty mouth to show him that it was all gone.  Then they made fun of me and asked me if I liked sucking their cocks.  I mumbled yes.  They said they couldn’t hear me and so I said yes again.  They told me to add the word Sir and say the whole sentence.  So I said, “Yes Sir, I like sucking your cock sir.’ They asked if I would like to thank them. Still on my knees, I thanked them.  Just saying ‘thank you’ wasn’t enough for them so one of them smacked me in the face and told be to say a whole sentence with respect.  So I said, ‘Thank you sir for allowing me to suck your cock, sir.’ They continued to humiliate me.  One demanded if I liked swallowing their loads.  Out of fear I said, “Yes sir I killed swallowing it all down, sir’. Then he demanded to know if I would like to suck them again. I said, ‘Yes sir I would like to suck you again sir.’  He made me kiss his cock and lick the oozing cum from the head and then the other brother shoved his cock at me so I had to kiss and lick it clean too. They made me say that I am a sissy and then kiss their cocks again.  It was so humiliating. The one took a photo of me with my mouth full of his cum, and another photo of his cock in my mouth.  He said if I don’t do as I’m told, he’ll show the photos to everyone. I have to meet them in the bathroom again tomorrow.  I don’t know what they’ll do to me.

I commonly and freely pay my dear wife a “Tribute” to have sexual contact with her anyway. But it was our anniversary. Before yesterday, I was allowed a “Free Pass” on my birthday, our Anniversary, Valentine’s Day and Christmas. I was expecting a “freebie” so to speak. But I was wrong. My wife laid down a new law and that is OK with me. I know and I accept and I confess that I am unable to properly arouse and satisfy my wife sexually, and that I inspire in her little desire to have sex with me. That being the case, I can totally see where she would ordinarily not want to have sex with me out of mere “obligation”.  I do not believe anyone should have sex with anyone unless they are passionately aroused by that person and desire it, or otherwise will get something out of the act. My wife now want’s–every time–to get something out having sex with me other than being left with what she calls my “nasty mess” between her legs and being made to feel like my sperm receptacle. In my heart I know my wife is right and I will proudly pay my “Tribute” to her. I also fully accept that while I have to pay for the privilege of sexual contact with my wife, she is still a sexual woman. I have already fully accepted that she may seek passion in the arms of a man whom she finds attractive and who arouses passion and sexual desire in her. I also fully accept that her lover will get free what I must pay Tribute for. I am my dear wife’s proud submissive cuckold. I know she loves me. But, as she has often said, “Love is love and sex is sex”. As an extension of her love, my wife is coming to the full realization that it is good for our relationship that I be made to submit to her, sexually in this way, and in every way. I will be sending her the link to this and another “confessions” from my heart now that she opened the floodgates yesterday. I very proud to write this to her. With the world as my witness. I love you, My Darling. I want you to know that I am proud to be your obedient husband and your submissive cuckold.

And I had to tell my classmates that I was not sure I saw him do that either cause I didn’t want them to be mad or hate me for getting him into trouble. Yeah cause it’s not like I was watching him as he pushed the table that crushed my finger. As he was walking to the headmaster’s office someone from my class told me to go and defend him. I was crying I a corner. And he’s happy with no care in the world. He even told us that he doesn’t think he was the one at fault and that he told everyone he’s guilty so he could be left alone at once.

Not necessarily because of your looks, although I don’t think any sane person could look at your jawline and not be a little swoon by it, but because of the way you carry yourself. Effortlessly, almost arrogantly. Like you are so at peace with yourself in your own skin that no disruption could shake you, not even touch you. I love the way you walk, how you take up space wherever you go; like you’ve been there million times before, like you are the centre of everything without making a fuss over it. You make me wonder, with your easygoing confidence and striking blue eyes: what goes on inside your head? Is it all just a well preserved surface, shielding all things inside you from the world to see? Or is the way you truly are, how you exist; outrageously without imperfections? Are you truly made of steel or is there something ugly inside, tender and raw? You are like a puzzle, a problem waiting to be solved, and I want to pick you apart. And it drives me near madness to know our paths most certainly don’t collide. My heart yearns to be the reason you turn your head, the reason you forget what you were about to say in the middle of a conversation.

Secret.create(id: 203118, content: "Yup, gay dude who is fucking his alkie roommate while he’s out cold during his drunk blackouts.  To catch you folks up, I decided on molesting him as revenge after a few times of having to pick his skinny drunk ass up out of the floor and putting him to bed (after putting  up with him acting the fool for hours before finally blacking out).  For weeks in the fall term I would eat and finger his asshole and suck him off by stimulating his prostate, training his ass to eventually take my dick. After the spring term started, I began gently fucking his ass and forcing him to cum.  He’s still plenty tight, so I ate his ass good and fingered him good before finally starting to work my dick into him.  I’d always pull out when he started to cum, to spray my load onto him before cleaning him up good.  This evolved into me giving in to my desires and I’ve been shooting my cum into his asshole – him spraying his load triggers this.  I just love how his asshole clenches and relaxes around my cock while he’s nutting.  While I was terrified about him discovering my load, he mostly passed it off as bad food.  That first morning after I heard him on the toilet passing VERY wet farts.  He must have passed it off on too much drinking/greasy foods, etc., because he never said anything. I’ve fucked him several times since then and have become a lot more at ease breeding my loads into him.  His asshole has changed dramatically with all the fingering and fucking.  While still pretty small (at least before I fuck him), his asshole has transformed from the tiny round butthole he had in the fall into a nice short slit.  He opens pretty easy with a little rimming and fingerbanging, and it doesn’t resist penetration nearly as much.  I’ve told a gay fuckbud about him, and decided it was time to share the pussy I’d built in this drunk fucker. We’d been invited to a party at a house on a nearby lake, and while he wasn’t REAL excited, I’d managed to talk him into it with the promise of a never-ending supple of beer and harder liquor.  That was all it took.  I told him I was inviting a friend to join us – he’s met him before in passing, so it was no big deal. Saturday night we arrived to a pretty good crowd, and no big surpise, he started drinking like  a fish.  My bud and I kept an eye on him and when he started getting pretty sloppy we talked him into joining us in the pool house to keep drinking and talking, etc. My bud talked him up pretty good (they share the same major), and things were going pretty well.  They talked about that shit, and past relationships.  Roomie had a few girlfriends before but his social anxiety and drinking kept him from making any real connections.  Then they got flirty, which surprised the shit out of me.  The talk turned to sex, and whether roomie had experimented before.  He told us about circle jerks in high school and even disclosed some mutual handjobs with buds before. Before I’d even had time to process shit, my friend had talked my roomie into trying head from a guy.  It was funny at first – he seemed shy and embarrassed and make us swear never to tell anyone.  Of course we did (without disclosing he’d been getting sucked off, rimmed, and fucked for awhile during his blackouts).  He finally relaxed into the suck job he was getting and didn’t protest until my bud raised his legs to expose his asshole.  He didn’t want it, he said.  My bud finally talked him into trying it and starts licking his asshole.  I’m literally in shock, and a  little afraid my bud would out me accidentally while he was going after the roomie’s hole. Roomie is moaning like a fucking slut tho and saying how his mind is fuckin blown.  My bud starts slipping fingers into his hole and roomie is writhing like a cat in heat and asking him to slow down, he’s gonna nut and shit.  Before I know it, my bud raises up and pulls his dick out and says he’s gonna try to fuck him.  Roomie’s face just goes WHITE and says no way.  They go back and forth a bit, but roomie finally agrees to let him try but makes him swear to stop if it hurts – and he has to use a rubber. No worries (I am always prepared).  I bring my bud a rubber and some lube and roomie is looking at me like…what is happening…haha..my bud snaps on a rubber and plants his dick at roomies hole and starts gently humping in.  Roomie is watching bug eyed  while my bud fucks his dick into his asshole…hissing a little, brows furrowed…but that dick is ROCK HARD.  I’ve trained this bitch well. Before long, my bud is full on fucking the shit out of him and roomie is jacking his cock – moaning and groaning but not saying anything intelligible.  He cums and sprays his load all over himself (I’ve seen this before) and my yanks his cock out of him, pulls off rubber, and jacks his load all over roomie too. I’m just watching.  I’m rock hard but just watching.  I ask roomie if he is ok and he’s quiet as fuck…wanders off to bathroom.  I hear the shower kick on and my bud is laughing his ass off, and I tell him to shut up.  When he gets back we just go back to drinking, but move on to harder stuff pretty quick.  It didn’t take long for roomie to go out like a light.  I take the opportunity to ride his ass then and I am shocked how wet his cunt still is – and fucking his awesome knowing someone else had just ridden him. We went ahead and cleaned him up, dressed him, and we all went home with my bud dropping us off at the dorm.  Sunday he was pretty quiet, just working on stuff for classes and didn’t drink that night.  He also has not mentioned what happened yet, although I may bring it up at some point to see how he’s doing. So anyway, although he may not know how exactly he got it – he knows he has a pussy now.", category: "a guilt", likes:  10, dislikes:  3)

I remember one time his Mum came over to our house with him and he walked up to me and sat down and started talking about how he got in trouble for no reason and then his Mum dragged him out of our house because he was just speaking his fucking feelings.

I got on top of him and rubbed some lube on and inside of his hole which somehow got us both even more excited. We moved a lot faster after that. I put a lot of lube on my dick and rubbed against him. We were both breathing hard even though we didnt do much yet. My brother held himself open and let me push into him raw and it felt so good. He’s so tight and warm he feels better than any girl I’ve had sex with. He was being so loud but he said it didnt hurt too bad even though I was his first. He came in only a minute since I was rubbing against his prostate and it felt so good feeling him squeeze against my dick when he came. He let me fuck him really rough after that even though he was overstimulated. I got to cum inside and it was so tight and warm where I was inside him. I loved that so much and when he came again.

I decided to invite him back to my place. I didn’t, and still don’t know, if I did it because I figure that’s the closest I would get to the girl or because I wanted to show her I was desirable or just to get back at her for friend zoning me.

She and her mother aren’t always the best to each other, and for some background we all three smoke marijuana for anxiety and certain pain conditions. I stayed with my friend for a night and we were all driving home with her mother the next morning and she had had a really bad morning already. She asked us if we had any pot and we had to admit we didn’t as we’d smoked the night before and not saved any for the morning. To make things clear right now, it was my pot, and not my friends (this is important to the story trust me). I shared with them often as I know how hard it is to come by. I explained this much and my friend pipes up from behind me, “Yeah we only had like one bowl.” I knew this wasn’t true. I don’t lie to people on their best days, and sure as hell don’t lie when someone is already having a bad day. I made a face and said, “But we had two.” In less than a second I feel a sharp pain in my shoulder and she is yelling at me, “Way to fucking rub it in!” It was about this time I realized she had actually punched me, fairly hard, in the shoulder for telling her mother how much I had the night before. Not only had this girl tried to lie to her own mother about something, she was trying to lie about something that didn’t even belong to her! I don’t deal well with pain in the best of times, but this actually fucking hurt and even STILL does a bit a day later, making me question just how she could get so mad about something that wasn’t hers. I glared back at her and said, rather loudly actually, “It’s NOT your weed!” After this she went to work and remained cheery, even saying to me as she left, “I’ll text you when I get off work, I’ll see you later!” As if she hadn’t just assaulted me for NO REASON! Yeah, I haven’t talked to her and she has made no attempt to apologize. None. almost feels like 20 years means nothing to some people.", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

But we’ve become friends over the months. What I’ve seen some people do to him and his house over these months is inhumane. He begged me to spend the night at my house last night because someone threw a death threat through his kitchen window. I allowed him to stay in my guest bedroom and I was bringing him some tea after he’d showered and was ready to go to bed but I caught him crying. He pretended he wasn’t but I sat next to him and we talked for hours- I hugged him until he fell asleep (no sex). But something he revealed to me shattered my heart- he said that he didn’t feel safe anywhere, not even in his own home. He had been hurt physically, mentally, and sexually (someone kicked his genitals), ever since he’s been on the sex offender registry. That is no life to have- not feeling safe in your own skin. I hope he feels safe at my place, at least.

What a fool I was… I did have my phone and I texted them a lot, but we were slowly drifting away, and heading our own paths. Only one friend remained, and wed text everyday. She was one of my best friends and still is. There was this app she really liked, and she constantly begged me to get it. So finally one day I did after a while of her pleading just to get her to shut up. We were both a fan of some shit indie band, I dont even know what its called, so we spent all our time talking about it on the app. Everything was time and good, for her, but slowly, as my life got worse with no friends and a crippling fear of people, my posts became more and more disturbing. I drew some of the most horrible things and posted it sometimes without a trigger warning at all. I liked to roleplay and my roleplays were filled with all these horrible things. I freaked out everyone, even my best friend asked me several times to bring things down a notch because I was just taking things too far, but sometimes I didnt listen. I never listened to anyone. The app was slowly taking me over. I became less social, less friendless, which made me even more sad, which made me post even worse things and do even more disturbing things in my role-plays. When I tried to talk about my feelings to my “””””””””girlfriend”””””””””” she started to cry, because I told her I was having thoughts about ending my life. Our relationship crumbled from there. I became more and more canned in and I had reached my disturbing peak. after a while we broke up, and my parents made me rid of this app (god bless them) after they found out I was talking to a heavily suicidal girl. They never saw any of the posts, thank god. to this day I think about it. I can’t stop thinking about it. Songs from that horrid band get stuck in my head sometimes, bringing me back. Sometimes I just randomly remember a scene from a rp. Sometimes I remember the break-up with Hannah (I am Really happy I broke with her though. I finally see that I am straight and since that realization ive been so happy.) sometimes I think about that overly suicidal chick. It never leaves my mind, and every time my friend talks about the app and how much fun she’s having on it I get the most horrible flashbacks. It doesn’t help I tried apologizing to Hannah and she didnt forgive me and ranted on how much of a freak I was… I just want to forget but I cant… I remember everything… im going to cut it short here, but know I have so much more to say. There is so much I have to remember", category: "a guilt", likes:  0, dislikes:  1)

She smoked all the time, two to three packs a day. She seriously couldn’t go a half hour without a cigarette. after college She got a job working from home so she could smoke whenever she wanted. Of course her smoking sky rocketed after that – I don’t think she ever smokes less than three packs a day now 26 years later and she still is just chain smoking away – and still coughing constantly and hacking up nasty brown phlegm I went out on a date recently since I’m recently divorced and she just moved back to town Man shes still pretty but also looks rough. Skinny and she’s only 46 but looks more like 60 or older. smoking has wrecked her She tells me she spits up blood every morning and is worried because she doesn’t have insurance anymore since she works as an independent contractor doing medicall billing review Even though she’s still rail thin she’s so outta shape she can’t even walk up a flight of stairs without wheezing and gasping for air Even lying to her insurance company she still can’t afford insurance Her 14 year old daughter used to beg her to quit smoking but apparently now she started smoking cigarettes herself and her mom just lets her – even buys them for her – no kidding she was even secretly smoking cigs while baby sitting! Anyways it’s crazy stuff. I smoked for 24 years myself and quit 2 years ago… after my own daughter was born but Now that I’m back wanting to see my old ex girlfriend again- I found myself buying a few packs and smoking again she kept offering me cigarettes and asking me to please go out to smoke with her so she didnt have to smoke alone out in the cold on our first date in 25+ years! so with her begging me to smoke with her of course I said yes Crazy how easy it is for old habits to creep up on you!!!", category: "a wild experience", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

But, all of the aforementioned whilst worthy of note do not mention the ‘soul bond’. A soul bond [for you atheists ‘mind meld’] will perform relationship miracles. How so? A soul bond is karmic and very serious chapter of learning steps to a greater understanding of the self. How often do you try to understand yourself by interacting with ‘other’s rather than truly contemplating your true inner being. It is so crucial to the true self to understand first YOU before you can understand anyone else. All superciliously surface ‘enlightenment’ is easily negated by self-assured failure. Did you read that right? Yes. Self-assured failure is the crux of many a megalomaniac episode of self realization writ wrong. To think inward is retrospect and to think outward is circumspect but to truly navigate the passages of your thought processes in the here and now is to be reading this right now in real time and understanding just how precious time is and how special you are and how important it is to make the most of……..", category: "a truth", likes:  2, dislikes:  1)

Secret.create(id: 202534, content: "Mindful spooning by doctor Angeline Burnett As we gravitate to unrealistic expectations in our modern world, wanting more and more frivolous needs met by ever increasing mind-numbing stimulus, we so easily allow ourselves to be the subjects of our own internalized need for gladitorial, dark and even violent ends to no means. If we tear down our own external and internal existential gravitas, we lay bare our true selves wholly without thought or perceptions of any encumbering external pressures. Lying is just a form of fear of the self. Once we accept the self, truth triumphs over lies and henceforth the more we accept ourselves the less we feel the need to lie. As to mindful spooning. When we spoon as a couple, we become one in a fetus like embrace. It is both special and important in the bonding process for humans in that we nakedly allow our most primal brain to allow another being to inhabit a part of who we are in real time. The primal need for touch and scent and feel has been proven in mammal studies in that we are not just possessed of a need for creature comforts but true and genuine affection and empathic give and take of needs. Our brains tend to make new pathways as our hormones wax and wane in both stimulation and need which can lead us not only into riskier behavior but life-altering changes in our overall outlook on life.", category: "a truth", likes:  4, dislikes:  1)

The feminist movement is nearing closer to the Nazi’s from WW2, who seeked “death to all jews.” I’m seeing the two starting to become one, with the “Black Lives Matter” not being far off. I’m not racist or sexist, but Amelia Earhart would be disappointed in feminists today. Martin Luther King Jr. would be disappointed in the BLM movement.

Secret.create(id: 202372, content: "this is super personal and people might find it gross and judge me for it but I need some serious advice here.. so Im a straight male 29 years old and have a girlfriend ive been with almost 10 years. We are very close and love eachother dearly.  sometimes we get super close to a point where we will go to the bathroom together (#1 and #2).  we will ask eachother “come with me?” and while her and/or myself are on the toilet doing our business we will just chat about how our day was or whatever..  not sexual, just casual, natural, since were that comfortable around eachother. however, having been doing this for the amount of years we have been, Im noticing for some reason or another Ive become sexually interested in this behavior that her and I have in the bathroom.   I have no desire to Pull turds out of the toilet and play with them or do any horrifying stuff with them like some people do (not judging, just not for me). I just really like watching her more than ever.  the sounds, the sight of it, the smell.  stuff like that.  I want to watch it come out of her ass (without touching it) but im afraid to ask her Its to a point now where if theres a time where we cant go to the bathroom together (like if were out with friends, have company over or at a family members house or something like that) where its not apropriate to go to the bathroom with her without it being weird for everyone around us. She will mention to me she has to go and is going to go and be right back.  no big deal but in my mind I start getting this crippling anxiety because she will text me while in there and tell me that shes droppin a load or something just out of humor.  we will txt back and forth so shes entertained while in there i suppose.. (sometimes she can take 5-15 min.)  which im happy to do but because when shes in there and I know about it and cant be there I start getting anxious and nervous because I want to be in there and watch. I have no desire for this strange fetish to go away, not sure if I plan to tell her about this either.  i want her to be able to go alone if she wants to, i love her so much and want to respect her wishes in all aspects.  but I really want to figure out how to control this anxiety.. we are moving in together for the first time in a few months and I fear that once we live together she wont want me go to in the bathroom with her anymore and watch/chat with her like we used to.  Im assuming once we move in I should tell her and hope to god she doesnt hate me or judge me for it. she loves me enough where i dont think that would happen but im just so afraid.  we still go in there and she lets me watch but im so afraid if i tell her she will stop all together.. I sometimes avoid going out with her and her family for fear she will have to go and i cant join her.  i wouldnt want to talk to her parents while in the middle of some strange anxiety attack. For the record, she has no problem letting me go in there with her during most situations, and she will join me in there as well but isnt as into it as i am.  if shes watchin a tv show she just stays where she is and i just do what i gotta do which doesnt bother me as much as i would think it would considering my issues. just dont want it to stop, and dont want it to get worse either.. anyone else have some weird quirk like this?  im trying to get some advice so i dont drive myself insane and not ruin anymore time out with my partner.  also dont want living with her to be full of anxiety and fear.  this is supposed to be the happiest years of our lives.. I love her so much beyond words.  and I want our bathroom thing to stay the same, or get better… my god looking back on this I got issues lol I appropriate any of you reading this and providing advice.

He’s got a long thin face, long nose, short light brown hair dark eyebrows, long eyelashes and brown eyes that sparkle when he flashed the occasional grin. He’s a very preppy clean cut kid. Although I’m just about as tall as he is and weigh much more, he’s actually quite physically strong and could probably kick my ass. The first time I noticed him was probably a few months before his 16th birthday, he was already sexually mature by then, the same height but maybe 10 lbs lighter- I was standing behind him at a bonfire, he was wearing his high school jersey and a pair of jeans and couldn’t help notice his cute little butt. I never thought much about it but I suspect over the last year or so he became sexually active and I’ve become very intrigued. He’s a college freshman but lives at home and there were a couple of occasional nights where he went to campus or to a girl’s house and ended up spending the night. I’ve casually glanced at his crotch and don’t really observe much of a bulge- either that or he hides it well, and I’m very surprised because I simply assumed since he is tall and slender he would have a huge cock.  One night I woke up to use the bathroom and saw his laundry basket near the dryer. I took out a pair of his underwear (black boxer briefs) and began to sniff them but they were clean. I’ve even gone to the bathroom after he took a dump just to sniff his poop. On occasion I’m the only one home and have been tempted to go into his room and sniff his dirty briefs or hopefully find a used condom and suck the cum out of it…Should I? No one would be the wiser… but I may feel very guilty..then if I don’t I may regret that I didn’t *****Update*** I was working from home today and my stepson had to get to school a day early since he works there part time as well.. A few minutes after he left I found a pair of boxer briefs in his bedroom that he just changed. I took a big whiff, especially where his cock and balls would be as well as the crotch… It was incredibly intoxicating… A deep rich musky aroma which I can describe as sheer masculinity, youth, virility and sexuality, unfortunately no cum stains. I didn’t find any used condoms but found an already open box of condoms in his underwear draw as well so he is obviously sexually active which I already suspected. I feel guilty because it seems like not long ago he was just 9 years old and I’m completely disgusted with myself, but then I have to rationalize that he is now almost 19 so I’m glad I satisified my curiosity. I’m glad I wasn’t caught because although he doesn’t look it, he is really strong and would surely kick my ass ***second update**** My wife and I went out of town for a few days so my step son had the house to himself. We had to get home a day early due to unexpected bad weather. When we got home in the evening my step son’s bedroom door was closed. Then a about 10 minutes later the door opened and he had a friend from high school over. She seemed nervous, almost embarrassed when she left, my wife didn’t think anything of it because she thought they were platonic friends. My step son’s friend is also about 18 or 19 about average height, maybe 5’5″ she has long dark brown hair, a round face with a nice smile- she’s got a little extra in the ass and thighs (just a little) but a slim waist and perky medium sized tits. The next day I decided to work from home and when my wife left for work and my step son went off to school I found lavender panties in his laundry (obviously hers) and found not one but two used condoms in his wastepaper basket. First i couldn’t get over the load left in both condoms- the ejaculate was much larger than I ever could produce. I took his dirty boxer briefs and her dirty panties and put them on his bed and then put his briefs on top of hers. I was amazed that her panties was at least 2 inches wider than his briefs on both ends. I backed out of sucking the cum out of the used condoms, I just couldn’t do it. But I did take some of the ejaculate and I put it on a glass slide and got my microscope out. I’ve never looked at semen up close like that and I was enamored by the large amount of dead sperm.. I’m just so amazed how when I first met my  step son he was a  cute 9 year old kid and has now become a nearly 19 year old bull stud.", category: "a guilt", likes:  1, dislikes:  3)

Secret.create(id: 202308, content: "My former mother in law was more of a mother to me than my own harpy of a mother ever was.  I say former mother in law because she passed away several years ago.    For a fairly brief period of time, thanks to a somewhat unique series of events, she would masturbate me occasionally. I was in my 40s, she was in her early 70s, she was still married to her husband of over 50 years at the time, and I was still married to her daughter at the time. I get that I used to have my fair amount of mommy issues in my life, and it was profoundly inappropriate for that to have happened with my former mother in law for a whole lot of reasons, and I even get that she probably was doing it because she felt sorry for me.  I wanted to be in her bed as a man to her, not as a surrogate for things I never had.  She was a loving compassionate woman, very kind and understanding.  My past childish mommy issues aside, I respected and adored my former mother in law.  She treated me with caring/compassion, and respect as only one other woman (my current fiance’) ever has.  The times my former mother in law masturbated me were not a roleplay or other type of thing, she made it clear that she was doing it because she cared about me, and as she said to me more than once, “a man needs a woman to give him what he needs, it is not good for a man to only have his own hand.”  Of the many long talks I had with her at her own kitchen table, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee, no topic was uncomfortable. It was that way before the period of time that her masturbation of me occurred, and it was that way after that period of time came to an end. She did not allow me to give her pleasure in return; I wanted to and offered (ok begged)  to be allowed to be in her bed as a man for a woman. Nothing more than her masturbation of me ever occurred, though I wished it could have been.  I would have gladly been with her as the woman in my life and she knew that.  I often longed to know what it would be like to be tangled up in that comfort, moving together as lovers, in passion not pornographic ways. Being in her bed as man and woman would dominate my own self pleasure visuals after that, and the memories of her touch, the desire to be her lover, did not pass, and still come to mind occassionally amidst the many memories I have of her, at her best and worst moments.  She was not a stereotype beauty, but I have never been better than utterly plain to unattractive.  She was quite short and thickly built, and all I saw was how she treated and cared for me.  She was never cold in her rejection of my desire to be her lover or her full real partner, she always acknowledged it without hurting me. Obviously she had more consideration for what it would do to an entire family for she and I to be together as man and woman.  I get that she may not have seen me as a desirable lover or partner.  When she passed away, it crushed me, but I had to put on the brave face because her husband and daughters were grieving and that took priority over mine.  I dealt with my loss internally.  To this day, I realize how much she meant to me and brought into my life long before, and long after, the brief period of time that she gave my body something it needed as well.", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

We did it every morning in my officer, then sometimes at lunch we would do it in a public parking lot in his vehicle, and then again in my office before we would leave work for the day. And on days when we would have a “date” day and would go to a motel with a spa tub we would fuck to the point of exhaustion, toys, straps, we did it all. So anyway, I haven’t had sex in awhile and this morning decided to have a little shower fun. (Somewhere else he and I used to fuck the shit out of each other). Well this morning made me end up laughing, thinking of how he would react right now if he felt how incredibly tight I am. I mean, I’ve always been tight (which he LOVED), but right now I am so tight that I can’t even get the tip or any of a dildo inside of me, even with a ton of lube! See he also used to love to put his fingers in me too (especially when we were driving) but right now I bet he couldn’t even get one inside. He’s very well endowed (at least to me he is). I used to ride him anywhere and anytime I could, but right now he would probably rip me in half! I don’t miss all the bullshit that our relationship had to endure, but some days I do miss our sex life. We fucked like porn stars, and are not all that young either. We never missed a day of sex even for my period. In fact I would call him if my cramps were awful and tell him I needed my natural pain medicine (his dick!) and he was always happy to come take care of me.

On some occasions she has let me stay inside her when I cum but not very often. Well last night we went out and got home really drunk upon going to bed and before we started to do our business I asked if I could stay inside her when I cum and to my amazement she agreed. Well she was really drunks so as I came close to that point I rolled her onto her stomach to get behind her the same way I always do just this time I quickly took off the condom and continued when I reached that point I just let it go hoping she wouldnt realize, after I realized she didn’t notice I kept going. Soon after I started getting soft but I just kept thinking about my cum all inside her and that thought alone got me hard again so I kept going until I filled her up a second time. We soon fell asleep but I woke up sometime through the night to use the restroom and upon returning to bet I curled up behind her and realized she was soaking wet from earlier so I slowly slid it in, this is when I noticed she didnt react at all. Thats when I got the idea, I layed there next to her pleasuring myself until I got that feeling then slowly slid in and moved just enough to make meyself cum inside her again. Now I know I should feel bad but I cant stop thinking about how hot it was and how it felt to know all my sperm was inside her. She asked me this morning what time we got home and basically explained that she didn’t remember even getting home. Of coarse I didn’t tell her she was now full of my sperm.

His pp was hard but only about a inch long I had watched my older brother porn tapes before I knew kinda what to do so I started sucking it he just lay back and put his hands on my head loving it. I started babysitting him as much as I could. Next time I started by sucking his toes then rimmed him good once I had him spit in my mouth while I was jacking off. I would sometimes watch him in the morning before he woke up I would cuddle up with him he often wet the bed and I would clean him with a washrag then one morning I just pulled down his underwear and licked him clean it wasn’t bad just a little bit salty. Lol I was a nasty kid!  He never wanted to do anything to me besides playing with my dick and balls so I didn’t make him. I started feeling bad about it and  stopped after a few months he wanted me to do it all the time  i know that it was wrong now but we have never talked about it since and we are still good friends and I love him.", category: "a first experience", likes:  0, dislikes:  5)

Secret.create(id: 201878, content: "Around 3 years ago I got my first girlfriend. We were in an off & on relationship, but I loved her. Most of the times it was me breaking up with her for a stupid and pointless reason. We usually got back together a week after that. Almost a year after we first started dating I broke up with her… I’m not proud of myself for it… I broke her heart for another girl. I regret it, and will carry this guilt and regret for the remainder of my life. It’s now been 2 years since I broke her heart, I haven’t spoken much to her for 2018. Just recently she said if we started talking again she might give me another chance… only I feel I don’t deserve it. When I broke up with her for some bitch I hardly knew, I could tell she was crushed. Despite her maybe being willing to take me back, I feel it’d be best to just let her go. I want to burn for the wrongs I’ve done to her, I deserve no less. If someone drew a gun on me, I’d tell them to go ahead and pull the trigger. I’ve come to terms with death, and whatever may await me… I hope I suffer. I know there’s worse people than me, but I’ll never be able to forgive myself for crushing her. In the last two years, since I broke up with her, I’ve avoided getting in a relationship. Apart of me wants to get back with her… but I’m also worried I’ll crush her again. I don’t want to hurt her again, so I might just cease talk with her and hope I become a distant memory to her. I hate myself for hurting her, I was selfish. For months after breaking up with her I started self harming, cutting my wrists for the pain. It took my mind off what I did, for awhile. I even started thinking it would be best to go ahead and off myself, but seeing as my uncle committed suicide that year on ST Patrick’s Day and I’m the last son of my family… I never did it.

We stayed up late and my parents let us just sleep on the floor in the living room. They went to bed. My sister fell asleep and I pulled up her shirt and pulled down here pants . I played with here tits and pussy and she woke up to orgasm . My cock was so hard and throbbing . I grabbed her by the head and forced her head down on my cock , she resisted at first than gave in when I started playing with a pussy again. It felt so good forcing her head down on me , even that she never did it before and she was using to much teeth (ouch). Then I cum she gaged and pulled out and I finish off on her face and tits. She giggled and smiled . At that point I knew what I wanted and I was going to have it. We talked and she said she was ok with it but did not want to get knocked up so we would have to play safe. I agreed . We would sneak around in to each others room and have safe sex – No condom just no penetration .We would have oral sex and tit fuck her and I would use my fingers on her. This went on every day some times twice for like a year. She ate gallons of my cum and had more facials than I could count. Then I talk her into anal sex , It was good and she would have an anal orgasm. As time went on and I was in love with her she let me take her virginity . She said if she becomes pregnant she would just blame it on having sex with a stranger that’s not around anymore. The sex with my sister was so good. We talked and we don’t want anyone else. Besides we are like best friends and the sex is good. We still do it every night. I got an apartment A few states away from where we grew up and she moved in with me . We have the same name on are Divers License ,So we just tell every one we are married. We got rings and we live as husband and wife. All this Time she never became pregnant .

I’m a guy, and I was somewhere around 5 or 7, around then I didn’t know much about sex or anything. I found myself in the living room, the family computer was in a corner with the screen facing the other side of the room. My dad was on it browsing the web at the time. I guess he thought I was asleep or wouldn’t/couldn’t see, but I definitely did. I saw all kinds of women on the screen naked, two of which caught my eye. I can’t recall how they looked or anything, but I remember the position they were in. One was on her back with her legs spread in the air. These pics only showed them naked, no dicks or sex toys were involved. The other had a woman was in a doggy style position, looking back at the camera. I ended up going to the master bathroom, taking my clothes off, and posed in those positions in front of a mirror on the door. I did this for awhile. Months later I was laying on the floor as a movie was playing on the TV, in the living room. My mom and dad were on the couch, and probably assumed I was asleep. About halfway through a girl with blue skin straddled one of the main protagonists. I’m aware she’s a marvel (I think) character, but I can’t remember her name. The were both naked and he started saying things to her like “Big ass, Big Tits, etc. And as he said these things her body changed to his preference. I don’t recall the movie’s name, but I remember that scene was in it. There were also multiple times when I found myself laying on the floor of the living room watching some movies such as I did then. That’s also when I got interested in horror movies, such as Scream & Jeepers Creepers. I’m unsure if they thought I was asleep all those times, or if they didn’t care.

Secret.create(id: 201738, content: "I was raised by an abusive mother in my father’s absence.  To a degree and in a way that was abusive to me, the abuse was sexual.  She kept me naive and ignorant, it was all about what an abomination males were and how no one would ever want me and that I should be grateful she tolerated my existence.  Thanks to the ignorance  I was raised in, it was many years before I realized that when she cast me out of her bed/from her side, it was because I reached puberty just like any other pedophile. The stereotype of mother/son incest that it is a loving way to teach or the husband/father is replaced by the son to fulfill her needs does not always apply, and it can be a very sick abusive thing to be brainwashed that way. One of her primary “lessons” was that the male body was disgusting and vile.  That men are fated to become enslaved to the flesh between their legs and that boys will inevitably abuse their own bodies.  So it was a very one sided form of abuse and brainwashing.  This led to a very ignorant aelf fulfilling prophesy, that my self discovery was accidental and very delayed.  While I eventually overcame it, her incessant brainwashing included raising me mentally and emotionally to be a girl or at least neutral/not male. To a degree, fairly effeminate.  In another place and time, had she been able to get away with/hide it, I have no doubt I would have been raised as a girl. The entire dynamic led to me acting out in ways that mostly nake sense, but for some time, until I was nearly 22, I was a borderline victim and at same time I was some form of borderline predator.  I had always been trained to avoid all men and women, but I think to this day that predatory men could smell it on me.  I was always getting approached by the stereotype older men once she shunned me and I was left to do whatever.  When those men would follow me and approach me at a mall or where ever, they genuinely frightened and disgusted me and I did not understand what they wanted or what they said to me. And, inevitably, that was the exact type of man that I was eventually drawn to for my first homosexual experience.  I wanted to know what it was like and needed to confirm my belief and curiosities about it.  And every one of my occasional homosexual experiences since then has been exactly the same type, an older man. And to this day, when I do do those things, while I will let such a man do whatever he wants with my body for his pleasure, I refuse to let a man give me an orgasm.  That always comes after, when his sperm is still wet on my skin or clinging in my mouth and throat, and I masturbate with such abandon voicing out loud to myself about what a total faggot cocksucker I am.  I became the very thing that my fucked up mother brainwashed me to become.

I was distroyed emotionaly for not being how she wanted. has any of you, anonymous readers bit beaten because you wanted to wear a pear of sports shoes and you mom thought they were too thin for the weather? i know, it s not that harsh, some people really have big problem. but for me, it meant that everything i do is wrong and someone will get upset. how do you think is feels to have your mom everuday tell tou that nobody will look at you or respect you because you are not as styled as her? you know how you grow up to feel? like the trash that not iven the dumpster wants but, the point is, one day, in the car, me, mom, dad, dad was driving and i was sleepy. i wanted to sleep and my father was not ok with it. (he is the one who tought me to sleep in the car) he said that if I fell asleep it would make me seek and this car of his was new 🙂 (he loved things, not people) ofcourse i fell asleep (i was in middle school) and he got so mad at me, for fucking sleeping ????  that he speeded tha car and sad that if my sleep is more important than his car we can all die. in a mountain road where he was suposed to turn right, he speeded and went in front, i tought that we were gonna die but my mom yelled so hard it scared (?? i quess or woke his up from his grandour?) my da and he stoped the car. that was one of the first times i had freezing amd blackout moment. so, there it goes with this. on the other hand, i m not gonna say it in therapy because than it eill make it more real and i don t want that. when i was i college i did something, but can t remember what and i anticipated him getting angry so i tought, for a second that that wa my end. i had a plan that if he kills me for what i did i will make sure he dies too. and that we can be even. it didn t happen, and i was glad but tought of all times i wanted to die and escape this shit life. there many stupid and terible stories like this in my life but they are not as important so, now, that i finally realised i was lining to make sure i dont upset anybody, i start to live for myself. it feels like a was born yesterday and descovering life. it s gonna be hard to not be passive and scared but it s a start for anyone reading this, the moral of story is, no matter how small tha trauma is, how big it is for you, what matters is you can make it trought, and you can make it all alone. so if you have mobody by your side, it mean you have the oporti itty to help yourself 💜 it a all that matters in this life love life no matter how fucked up it is and if you have a similar situation, know you are not alone, cause someone, somewhere, maybe in another continent, has the same fucked up view on the world and can change it 💜 you can change it, but only one tinny step at a time and blanket and warn tea, water, food, whatever you afford, can help you a lot", category: "a pain", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

Lately it’s been so hard….my best friend who I considered a sister (we’ve grown up together since 1st grade //I’m in high school now// and we’ve been through everything….however she moved away last year states away and just recently I found why she hasn’t been talking to me like we used to. She moved on and found her new best friend, who is going to turn into her boyfriend soon. It hurts a lot. I relied on her, we relied on eachother and we’ve been through everything together. She saved me from committing suicide in 2016, and I saved her in 2017 from doing the same. But last year things just fell apart like those 9 years meant nothing….I broke up with my ex (he was abusive and it was a super toxic relationship but that’s a different story) and got with a much better guy, sadly I struggle with multiple mental health problems, including PTSD from abuse from my childhood…I think it’s too much for him so recently I’ve decided to just pretend I’m fine when honestly it all hurts so much…I thought I was doing better, everything at the end of 2018 just collapsed and now I’m struggling to even get out of bed anymore. Tonight around 30 minutes ago I broke my no cutting streak as I’ve mentioned before, it took a while to get all the bleeding to stop…it’s all such a daze now. I’m sitting here, alone, thighs hurting, the emotional pain is squeezing the life out of me, but I’m also done. I’m done with all this shit…I’m so tired of it….but the most pathetic thing is I can’t bring myself to kill myself, to cut deep enough to get an artery in my inner hip….and yet everyone thinks I’ve been happier, that I’ve been doing better…glad to know my acting skills are still decent enough to pass by as that. Say what you will, honestly I’ve heard all of it, so if you want to post a rude comment just know I won’t care, I used to, but at this point it’s all just two big bloody middle fingers to the asshats…if you’re wondering, I’ve tried everything. Therapy, meditation, essential oils, transferring schools, new groups of friends, mental hospitals, etc…cutting seems to be the only moment of pure bliss I can get. Do I regret it later? Yes. But I find myself going back to it because out of these years it’s the only thing that seems to work is slitting across my thighs as deep as I can. I’ve stopped cutting myself for 6 months in the past when I thought I was in a more better place, but it’s always a temptation to cut again, to cut deeper no matter where I’m at in life. It’s so messed up but it’s true. But…I’m sorry I’m here, sorry if I seem like an attention whore, I’m just so done…I can’t even lean on my own boyfriend cause that sweetheart is going through crap of his own and I don’t want to keep stressing him about stuff like that, I’ve seen how much happier he is when I pretend to be happy then when i open up, when I open up and cry he seems stressed for days on end….why am I like this? Why is society so fucked up…? Why is the world so fucked up…..? I don’t understand, and honestly I don’t know if I ever will. I can see how much people are suffering too, but then there’s just those who I suppose don’t even have a heart and think that’s cool or something…i hope anyone who is reading this is doing okay, I can’t help but be worried for people on here in similar situations, but I hope you beat your own personal battles soon in life. Sorry this is a mini novel, I’m gonna try to sleep and I’ll clean and wrap up the cuts tomorrow then make sure no one knew what happened tonight, especially my boyfriend. Stay safe you all, and yes there’s so much more shit and chain reactions leading to this very moment but this isn’t a biography of myself so I’ll stop, but goodnight everyone. -IF YOURE THINKING OF CUTTING, DO NOT DO IT, ITS A LITERAL TRAP.

Secret.create(id: 201621, content: "In high school I dated this guy for a short time, but was realizing I liked girls. I was a firstyear and he was a junior. I knew he’d been sexually active before dating me and I was nervous he would want to be with me because I wasn’t ready. There was no actual pressure, he was great and I was attracted to him. But, figuring out I liked girls and being nervous about being with him was too much, so I broke up with him. If I could give my younger self advice I would say just to talk to him about it. But of course I was young. And it sucked because it hurt us both. We got over it and went back to being friends eventually, but we still had chemistry which only increased as we got older. Eventually I started dating girls and was in a relationship with one for most of high school, single for a while then dated another. He went to university to become an engineer and dated one of my friends for a while, but they eventually broke up. I was in a relationship for most of my time in college, but for the last year it was an open relationship and we didn’t see much of each other. So I decided to message this guy. I apologized for how I treated him in high school and explained everything I was feeling then. We started flirting a bit over text after that. One weekend I was home I texted and asked if he wanted to hang out and make out. The conditions of my open relationship were that I couldn’t have sex with other people but flirting and kissing and whatnot were fair game. Anyway, so he said yes and we hung out and talked for a while, and then we started kissing. After kissing girls for a while I have to say kissing girls is overall much nicer than kissing guys. But it was fine, we had chemistry and it felt really good to be wanted. I liked the feeling of his hands. We had to stop before either of us got too worked up so we just laid there together until I started to get tired and went home. We flirted over text every so often after that too. Things were going south with my girlfriend for unrelated reasons (she wanted more freedom, didn’t want to talk to me as much. And fair enough, long distance is hard) so it was nice to have someone express their attraction for me. Several months later I was home again and he asked if I wanted to hang out and I wasn’t feeling very well- on my period. So I said I wasn’t sure. We texted for a little while and he said he wanted to show me his new car (he was working as an engineer by that time) So I said sure. He came over in this nice BMW and I got in the car and he drove around to show me what it could do. Now, I’m pretty queer. I usually don’t go for this man being a man and showing off cars stuff. But for some reason it really got me going. The car was powerful, he was in control, it was exciting. Then we went back to his place and made out. It was pretty intense and quite enjoyable. I wanted to keep going but I was still in that relationship so I didn’t. But by then he’d figured out that I quite liked being lightly spanked. Mostly because I told him in a text previously. Something about his hands was perfect. I was straddling his lap and he gently but firmly started slapping in the perfect spot. I don’t know how he knew exactly where. But it that combined with the raw chemistry and the tension from having to hold back just drove me wild. I tried to stay calm but after 4 or 5 slaps I was on the edge of coming. I probably shouldn’t have, but I let him keep going and I came without him doing anything else. We laid there a while and eventually I had him drive me home. A few months later I had broken up with my girlfriend and was thinking about him a lot. So I texted him and we flirted a lot, but I wouldn’t be home from college for a while. He offered to come to where I was (about a 2 hr drive). I said yes. He drove up that weekend, my roommate was gone. I was planning on doing all sorts of stuff with him. I usually can’t handle penetration though and he was sizable. A thick 6.5 inches is intimidating for someone who usually doesnt take anything. I considered (fantasized) about going down on him. Maybe I would try getting on top of him to have control over speed and depth and all that. But when he got there he seemed kinda upset. Thinking back I think he might have just been tired from the drive and a little nervous. But it looked like he was sad, so I kinda went into friend mode trying to figure out what was wrong. He mostly just shrugged, gave me some partial answer. By then I wasn’t very excited anymore I was kinda worried. But after he got settled in we took a shower together. A good starting place. When we were done we moved to my bed and started making out. He touched me and it felt great. He made me come pretty quickly which was great but a little disappointing- I usually fail asleep after I come and I usually only come once in a night. But I kissed him and used my hands to get him off. When he came we didn’t really have a plan, so it got all over the sheets. I was used to being with girls so I totally wasn’t used to having to plan for that. We cleaned it up fairly quickly and he said something to the effect that he could be ready to go again in a few minutes and that we could do other things in the meantime. But I laid back and got a little tired and when he touched me it wasn’t as nice because I had already come. This was another time I really should have just used my words. I should have said that I got tired after and didn’t want to come early on. But anyway. So he tried fingering me, but I was tight and already done so it hurt a little and that put me off even more. So I kinda just kissed him a bit then snuggled against him and fell asleep. The next morning I woke up with his arm wrapped around me. Which was kind of nice but it was also big because he had been working out. So it felt heavy and for some reason I started getting anxious and feeling like it was hard to breathe. So I got up and went downstairs. I couldn’t shake the anxiety. I think we both started out the weekend thinking we’d be doing sexual stuff the whole time. But the energy was off from the beginning. Eventually I had to ask him to go home. Which I kinda regretted because he got ready to go almost immediately (he was always respectful about everything, never pressured me at all). But I couldnt shake the anxiety until a while after he left. We still texted a bit after that, but I don’t think we ever hooked up again. I had a FWB situation with a girl for like a year after that. I still think about that night he came over and how I wish it had been like those nights at his house- so hot and like we really wanted each other. I still think about how I never went down on him and how I want to know what that feels like. I think about how I never tried to see if I could ride him or let him fuck me. And I think him fucking my ass would feel so amazing. I’m confessing this because I still think about it even though he’s in a relationship now and I’m married. My wife is pan and in theory open to negotiating some form of open relationship. But I really honestly dont think I want that. But I think the idea that I ‘could’ makes me think about it more. Even if I did want it, I feel like I couldn’t bring it up to him. I feel like I’ve been in and out of his life too many times. Like it would just be unkind at this point. I’m hoping confessing and putting it down in words will help me get over it and stop thinking about it as much. Thoughts or advice?", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)
Secret.create(id: 201619, content: "My best friend of 7 years and I kind of confessed to each other our feelings but he has a girlfriend. They have been together for more than two years and I am happy for them. But he is always flirty with me, tells me how much he loves me and misses me and for most of the time I thought that it was all friendly love, but in my heart I knew he always meant something more. See the thing is, we liked each other throughout entire high school, but it never went anywhere, he had a girlfriend, than broke up with her, and my senior year i confessed my feelings once and for all. And we got together, but it only lasted like three weeks because I was scared and young at the time, I kind of ran away from the situation and I didn’t know how much it actually hurt him. We didn’t talk for a bit but eventually we started talking, I’m guessing because we missed each other. And so fast forward three years later, here I am thinking he has moved on and so should I but he is always flirting with me, and I couldn’t completely move on. I know it my fault it didn’t work out before, so I didn’t way anything. But it started to become really apparent and I started to feel that it wasn’t fair for me or his girlfriend. So one day I told him how I felt and how unfair he was being. And he told me he didn’t want to lose me, because he has before and it really really hurt and confused him. The only reason he got with his girlfriend was because he felt empty after I left. And he expressed his sadness when i told him i downloaded dating apps, but he couldn’t  say anything. He also assure me that he never intentionally tried to play me like that, and he thought he was doing a fair job of trying to hide his feelings, but it just comes out sometimes. And even now I feel better for sharing my feelings, I’m left in this gray area and don’t know where I stand with him. We text as we did before, but it’s still there in the back of our heads. And later this week he is supposed to introduce his girlfriend to me, and we haven’t talked about that conversation since. I’m hating myself for not keeping it inside at least until after I met her, but i couldn’t deal with him flirting anymore. I needed him to either stop flirting with me or decide what he wants.

And whatever she ate, I’d eat. I’m not sure why I was ever that way, but even when she was gaming I watched her play. I was an annoying kid growing up, but I’ve always looked up to my sister. She got me into the music I enjoy today so long ago, and she introduced me to gaming. If it wasn’t for her, I have doubts I’d be who I am to this day. Ages ago, before I knew anything about sex, when I was “innocent & pure” as some might say. I dreamt about me and her doing it in the bathroom. I’ve only told a friend of mine about this, and he gave me shit and joked about it with the others of our group. But for along while, I’ve had a thing for her. Before I knew what insect or any of that was. I found her dairy or something, where in it she wrote about her first time in bed with a guy. Plus on the side of the page I remember a drawing of a dick being on that very page. Last summer, due to some family matters, her and her husband came back home. They live on the West coast at this time, while I’m on the East coast. While they visited me and her went to see the movie A Quiet Place. On our entrance we got a drawing of us by some guy dressed as Deadpool. Who said or asked something about us being a couple. Her response took a few seconds, but she said we were brother and sister and no incest here. After the movie we went back to the house I stayed at, with my parents. Where we slept together in my bed. When she turned her back to me, and thinking about her big round ass… I had an erection for awhile. I couldn’t do anything about it, so I slept with it. Since then I’ve had a few dreams of me having sec with her. Some where I pull her pajamas and panties down and just get to it, as she sleeps. Some where she rides me. I love my sister, and I’m aware this isn’t normal.", category: "a guilt", likes:  1, dislikes:  1)

Secret.create(id: 201609, content: "I’m a guy who years ago had sex with his cousin. Who was also a guy. For context we were young and he showed me a porno mag, which wasn’t really the first time I saw images of naked women. After he showed me it we went inside this little playhouse building. It wasn’t large, at all. We had put up some blue styrofoam sheets that were thin to cover up the two windows and doorway. We also had a small peephole in on the door cover. We both got undressed, to be completely naked. I grabbed and started stroking his member off, but I ended up licking it. Then I took it out of my mouth and he bent over and looked out the hole, as he spread his rear for me. By this time I was hard and I thrust myself inside his hole and slowly thrusted in him. I had never done anything like this at all, so I was new to it. But there I was, thrusting in my cousin’s hole. Soon enough I pulled out and we switched, I bent over and looked out as he started thrusting inside of me. I enjoyed the feeling of it, even if it wasn’t much. After a little while his dad came outside and called for us. We quickly got dressed and went about the day. I don’t remember if we did it in there after that, but I remember as we were swimming he mentioned his d**k. So I went underwater and started sucking him off. I did this for less than a minute, when I came back up I saw his dad out on the porch. Luckily the pool was above ground and a ways away… not to mention we were on the side with our backs towards the porch. The next time I recall we did something like this stuff was when we were in my sister’s room. She was gone somewhere, and we come up with this idea. While one of us plays the game, the other gives them a bj. I agreed to it, and he started sucking on me first as I played. We had a blanket over us, just in case. At one point I let him play and I sucked his member. I got into it, and was enjoying it, more than I’d ever admit to him. I was so into it that I heard the door open, but didn’t come out from under till it was too late. There stood my mom, and she took the blanket off us to see our pants were literally down… puts a new meaning to “caught with our pants down.” Since then, we’ve never done any sexual things of the like. Or ever mentioned it. That was maybe 9 years ago today. He’s a year and a half older than me, and I’m the youngest of my family. Recently I’ve found myself reminiscing on the times we did that. And I’ve begun asking myself multiple things. Such as, if I should find myself alone with him… would I ask him about those days. It’s all theoretical, but those memories now turn me on. This is all a true story, and I recall and remember it in this way.", category: "a first experience", likes:  0, dislikes:  1)

Secret.create(id: 201566, content: "GOING DOWN TO BUSINESS CHAPTER 1 OUT OF 3 It was a tiring day at the office. After  typing out what feels like hundreds of documents, I just wanted to go home and vent off my stress. I waited at the bus stop where I saw this one hot brunette woman. She couldn’t have been any older than 30 years old but no younger than 20. She looked at me intimidatingly and I was a little bit uncomfortable. She proceeded to walk towards me and I had no idea how to react. “Hello,” I said hesitantly. “Hello to you too,” said the woman. “Beautiful weather, aint it?” “Yes, I guess the weather is quite nice.” An awkward moment of silence arose. At the time, I was so confused and I wanted to ask what was her motivation. Did she find me attractive, there’s no way such a hot woman would fall for me. I’m a mess. I’m working in some bullshit office for Christ sakes. “What do you want,” I said firmly. “A little taste, you know. That’s all,” she said. “Oh, um, I’m not a drug dealer,” I replied. “I wasn’t talking about that sweety”. She slowly moved her hand onto my penis, subtly stroking it up and down. “I wanna taste some of your fine meat,” she said to me. I instantly blushed and I could feel my blood pumping to my penis harder. I was so embarrassed and I pushed her hand away. Not like that helped though, as she kept getting closer and closer to me. I think she actually liked the whole concept of dominating me to fulfill her sexual desires. Honestly, I was kinda getting into it as well. Suddenly, I feel a poke in my neck. All I hear is her whispering “I’m gonna give you the best time of my life”. I couldn’t recall much of what happened afterwards. … “Your cock is irresistible. I must take a picture of it,” she said. My consciousness suddenly came back and I realized that I have been stripped naked with my legs and arms handcuffed. She was grabbing my penis very firmly moving it nicely up and down, occasionally licking the head of my penis and my testicles. I told her to stop and let me go before I would call the police. “Sorry, but I don’t think that’s going to happen. Besides, you wouldn’t call the police on someone who’s going to give you the best time of your life.” She releases her hand from my penis and instead holds the bottom of my shaft with her fingers. She takes a deep breath in, licked her lips, and then positioned her face in front of my penis. “I would never break my own promises”. She opens her wet mouth and devours my erect penis raw, staring deep into my eyes and smiling as my cock is positioned into her mouth. I gasped and lost some sensation in my arms and legs and it felt like at the time that my wet cock that was getting sucked off was the only thing in the world at the time. “I think I’m going to come!” I exclaimed weakly. “Holy fuck!” “Already? Damn I just must be too good for you. Besides, maybe it’s time for you to pleasure me for that wonderful blowjob of mine I just gave you,” she said. I looked confused, eagerly awaiting what was about to happen. I could see her getting off the bed, slowly stripping down to her bare, naked self. I was so ashamed, but I couldn’t stop looking at her butt and her large breasts. She was almost like an impression of Adam and Eve, except the Adam was a businessman chained to a bed. She walks towards me in a very sexual manner and then stands on top of the bed and then on top of me. I could not believe that I was staring at the butthole and pussy of a hot woman I saw at the bus station. I could see all the tiny creases in her butthole and I couldn’t stop looking. She noticed that I was liking her butthole and took two fingers to tug her anus apart and fully expose the inside of her rectum. She told me that if I behaved like a good boy, I would have the opportunity to stick my penis in there and fuck it as hard as possible. She also told me that it was time to get licking. “Um, licking what?” I said. “Since you like my butthole so much, let’s start with that.” Holy fuck. This was not happening. I couldn’t believe it. When she lowered her ass for me to eat and glaze my tongue upon, I took upon her request with no hesitation and went all in, stuffing my face into her cute, thick ass. I rhythmically licked her butthole bottom to top as it was ice cream. Even she moaned a little bit and told me what a filthy fuck I am. I continued with the licking and occasionally stuck my tongue into her anus. She made remarks like “Oh fuck you’re such a good boy!” and “Don’t stop please!” I heard the moaning become more frequent with her even starting to loose her ability to physically compose herself. Suddenly, I felt some of her pussy juice leaking onto my chest and she moaned like crazy. She raised her ass from my face and turned around. I could see her blushing and panting. She went down to my chest and licked up all of the pussy juice that came out. Then then approached my face. “How does getting fucked in the asshole sound?” she said. I blanked out for a little bit. The thought of me getting my pooper fucked posed a world I would have never imagined. But, how would I get my pooper fucked? “Yeah, um, how exactly will you fuck me in the ass?” I said. “Oh, I won’t. However though… he will.” TO BE CONTINUED", category: "a wild experience", likes:  1, dislikes:  1)

Dad left, and my mom is dependent on them and note: They never gave her actual money to spend on stuff. What’s bad about this? Soon comes the day where she asks that she wants some money, so they gave her a WHOLE LIST of things she needs to pay, saying that it costs her $30 EVERYDAY INCLUDING OTHER EXPENSES to live with them. The time of her taking care of my cousin (Everyday, including taking him to bed at around 10pm) DIDN’T EVEN PAY IT ALL. WTF- Okay? So because of how we won’t have money if we didn’t live with them, she decided to sell a plot of land to them. SURPRISE SURPRISE, IT DIDN’T EVEN PAY THE COST. We don’t even live in a fancy house or anything like that, me and my mom have to share a small room together. Conclusion? They’re greedy. My mom’s in debt and I don’t think I’ll be able to attend a college.

Secret.create(id: 201502, content: "Ever since I was a child, like 8 or 9, I always loved being pissed on.  By boys and girls both.  I have loved being pissed on by men and women both ever since.  It has nothing to do with degradation or submissiveness or humiliation, it is the direct physical rush of it, the warm wet splash and how it feels running across my skin.  And it is such an intimate personal thing.  While  I have done it many times in different settings, my favorite has always been in the bathtub because I can enjoy it, rubbing it all over my skin and in my hair.  The scent is fucking intoxicating, just like the scent of a woman’s pussy or a man’s cum.  I love the sensation of warm and wet and stickiness on my skin.  I even paid a male/female couple that were neighbors in a downstairs apartment a few times to fuck in my bed then empty their bladders in it while i waited in my living room and as soon as they were done I would literally roll in/sleep in it after masturbating.  For those of you who think that is too far fetched, it is a fairly easy thing to agree too when you are caught masturbating on your balcony while watching them have an early morning fuck on their balcony.  It just kind of evolved from that first time awkwardness both ways to them eventually giving me a heads up that they were about to fuck on the balcony.  We lived on the back side that faced a wooded lot. They would fuck while I looked down on their balcony from mine and masturbate while I watched them.  There were many different times/ways I watched them; they would never agree to let me watch them fuck in their bedroom, altho they seemed to feel sorry for me because they knew I never had any visitors.  One weekend morning they gave me a ring to come out and watch, by then it was common for all of us to see each other naked on our balconies.  My favorite was when hey would fuck in standard missionary and she would look up a lot watching as I stroked my cock.  One morning I was standing at the rail on my balcony and when I came my sperm went flying/dropping through the air lol. Since I had walked out with my morning hard on and took my sweet time jerking, by the time I shot my cum I could not hold the piss any more and it wqs a geyser and a rainfall.  It was sort of an unspoken dare or bond I guess because as soon as he had spermed her pussy he stood up and pissed off his balcony as she reached around from behind him and slowly jerked his cock as he went.  When he was empty I figured the show was over but he told me to wait.  They had a low conversation and then next thing I knew he was standing behind her spreading her lips and letting me see her piss too, altho I was equally fascinated with being able to see his sperm dripping out of her as she pissed.  I could not control myself I was hard and jerking off wildly as I watched.  They called me a couple of days later and were teasing about how I must be a piss lover.  Once the topic was out he told me she had liked watching me jerk off over them pissing, and the said they had talked about the new fantasy of both of them pissing on me while I stroked ny cock.  A bargain was struck, and the next weekend morning they came up, I had agreed to weat a blindfold and be waiting in my tub.  They came with their full morning bladdera, and bathed me in heir piss while I revellee in it, soaked and reeking of it.  Then lay there in my own bathtub soaked with their piss while I listened to them fuck in my bed, then empty their bladders in my bed.  I was told they bed was ready for me, and I spent that entire day in my bed, smelling of their sex and piss, annd it was rapture fir me.  I paid them for repeat experiences of it; once they left me the bonus of her dripping her freshly fucked and spermed pussy mixed with her juices on my pillow. Aside from a single experience in one type of theeesome years later, it was a fantastic way to enjoy my piss addiction as best I could.  I lay in my tub on my back and piss on myself whenever I can.", category: "a random feeling", likes:  0, dislikes:  4)

I ask her sometimes if I’m annoying or getting too close, and she usually says it doesn’t bother her.) It’s not even that I really want to stop loving her, because I am, as I put it, a clingy obsessive freak.

The only way might be to completely ignore her existence. But I really don’t want to do that either. It’s gonna be 10 times as painful if I cut connections with her, since we are very close friends, and that pain would last for a while before I actually stop loving her, if that even happens at all.

Secret.create(id: 201444, content: "Well, the deed is done.  I’m the gay guy with the drunk roommate who I’ve at this point been molesting for a few months and more recently been actively fucking while he’s blacked out drunk.  To prevent him from become too sore and finding out I’m fucking him, I’ve been pulling out of his ass after I force him to cum and spraying my load onto his before carefully cleaning him up. While he was visiting his family this past weekend I made the decision that my loads need to be shot into him from now on.  I realize there is a likely possibility that he will discover my sperm because my loads are rather large, but I want to do it. He got back to school around 6 last night and I had him set up to get blackout drunk.  We ordered pizza at first and had some small talk, but he wasn’t drinking.  It worried me, but I didn’t want to push.  I pretended to not notice and just went to the fridge to get one for myself – I’d stocked up on his preferred brand.  It did the trick and asked me to get him one after I popped the top.  We finished the pizza and he had several to my one in little time.  After pizza and watching some TV, I poured myself a bourbon and offered him one – he accepted.  The lush was in high gear after that, chugging beer and having shots of bourbon in quick succession. By 10:30 he was blurry as fuck but talkative, so I let his drunk ass blather on and laugh, tell stories, etc., while I finished up some reading for a Monday class.  I heard a thump in the bathroom when he went to piss and knew it was time.  Sad little fucker passed out on the bathroom floor again.  I found him on his side, boxers around his ankles (we’d had a few nasty interactions because he couldn’t hit the toilet piss drunk, so he had started sitting to take a leak). As I’d done so many times at this point, I went ahead and removed him from his boxers, picked him up, and went and put him on his bed.  My dick is already rock hard at this point and eager to get into his tight little cunt again.  I go fetch my lube from my room and grab a towel for cleanup after, shucking my jogging pants as I go.  I return to his bed finding him snoring and I’m eager but realize I need to slow it down.  As always, I left up his legs and position him for easy access to his asshole, cock, and balls. On impulse, I snap a few pics of his hole with my phone – his cunt is developing nicely, i think.  He had a very small butthole the first time I saw it, but it’s lengthened and elongated now.  Not a pussy yet, but definitely looking more like a slit rather than a tiny round hole.  He groans nicely now when I work on his hole – my hot tongue is welcome there now.  One leg on my shoulder, one leg held high with my hand, I lick and suck on his helpless asshole.  I want him hard for this, so intermittently take his cock into my mouth and suck him to full hardness, taking the opportunity to begin to lube up his fuckhole. I’m in heaven propping my erection against his now wet and relaxed cunt.  I stroke his dick in time with my gentle thrusts to keep him rock hard while i slide into his hole a little at a time.  Still very tight, but so much easier than just a couple of weeks ago.  In no time, my thick bush is resting against his asshole and I’m enjoying the feeling of a heartbeat.  I watch his cock and realize it’s his – his dick is gently throbbing in time with it’s beat. I start to fuck and it’s better than it’s even been.  I drag my dick out of him until just the head is held by his throbbing sphincter before pushing it back inside him balls deep.  I love watching his cock thicken and throb while I pump his new cunt.  I love knowing I can force him to cum anytime with just my dick now.  It’s been several days since I’ve cum and i know I wont last long anyway. I dick his asshole long and pick up the pace.  I have been so gentle fucking his hole until now, but I want to properly fuck him.  He begins to react more strongly now, moaning and groaning and his dick is a mess, leaking precum.  I give into it and begin to pump him harder, long smooth full length strokes.  I feel him and see him cum.  Jets of precum spray and his cunt begins to squeeze and relax around my dick – I’m gonna cum too.  I bury myself deep and feel my cum inject his cunt while he sprays his load all over himself. We both shudder in our mutually shared orgasm.  I’m pushed out of his hole after a few moments and it was as delicious as I thought it would be.  My heart is pounding as I clean his load off him, wipe his asshole, but realize the deed is done.  My big load is inside his cunt now and there is nothing I can do about it.  I fetch a washcloth as I always do to be as thorough as I can.  I put his boxers back on and cover him.  I gather all my fuck supplies and return to my room to sleep. It’s almost time for his alarm.  He has class soon.  I’m terrified but thrilled that my load is either leaking out of his cunt now, or will be very soon. I wonder if he will realize what it is?", category: "a guilt", likes:  25, dislikes:  3)

I had been alluding to this with my ex wife when we were newly married and she always said she would love to see me having sex with another man.  Well one day she asks me if she can fuck me that night.  I’m so surprised how blunt she was about it.  I smiled and said yes.  So we drove to the sex store and parked outside she said “well if you want to het fucked go buy yourself a cock” and left me to go into the store alone.  There were a decent amount of people in the store and I browsed the strapons until I cam across the one, a white 9 inch very realistic veiny cock.  I walked up to the counter nervously and so obvious that I would be on the recieving end of the toy. I brought it out and she said good boy to me.  After getting home I showered and shaved myself nice and smooth and made sure I was cleaned up.  When I went in the bedroom she was standing there and told me to get on the bed. I climbed onto the bed and she told me to bend over.  Then she presses the cock against my asshole and tells me “if you want it so bad then back up onto it and show me.” That was probably the sexiest thing I have been told about taking a cock.  I eased myself back onto it eventually taking the whole 9 inches.  I was so excited and rock hard.  She held my hips and thrust into me telling me how sexy i looked with a cock in my ass and saying baby you look so damn hot right now.  I was 21 6’4″ 185lbs with an 8 inch cock myself and at the time and she was 23 5’0″ 125lbs and nice by d cup tits. She fucked me a lot but I never opened up enough to suck it.  Now with my current wife I am such a slut for it.  She calls me her cock whore, cumslut, cumdumpster.  It’s all playful and I love the role reversal. I have yet to take a real cock.

Secret.create(id: 201339, content: "I was sexually active with my first girlfriend 8.5 year prior. It took the death of a friend my age to shake me enough into repentance and breaking off that unholy relationship. Over the next 8 years I thought I was leaving my sexual activity behind me until I was married to my wife, and was very much so while dating various girls. A half year ago my newest girlfriend and I were falling deeply in love. We starting things off right, no sexual contact and building our emotional and spiritual connection without any pressure to dive into the physical aspects that most of our culture makes relationships about. She is a very active believer serving in many areas of her church. She is also a very curious person and also a virgin, so eventually after a period of spiritual weakness (Lack of personal commitment prayerfully and scripturally in my life), I allowed her to touch me in intimate places. Over the next few months this lead to further exploration to the point where it was starting to spiral out of control and basically doing everything that was not technically sexual penetration. We were trying to get away with acting on our lust while still being able to claim we were saving sex for marriage. This entire time I would feel convicted as things were getting heated but too weak and lustful to act upon this prompting. Then God came knocking at my door with a wake up call. Boom. Conviction that I cannot ignore, guilt, shame…. Especially in the aspect that I was ignoring the clear warnings from God to stop and steer clear. This is all healthy as it will lead to repentance, so that we can truly live in forgiveness. We both have renewed our commitment to be fully pure, but I fear that I will forget the lessons I’ve learned once again, and ignore the conviction that steers from sinful acts. I earnestly ask for your prayers for not just the two of us, but for the other people who have posted.

I’ve known my step son since he was 8 or 9 years old. He’s now almost 19 years old. He’s tall about 6’2 or 6’3, very slender, about 150-155 lbs but with an athletic build. He’s got a long thin face, long nose, short light brown hair dark eyebrows, long eyelashes and brown eyes that sparkle when he flashed the occasional grin. He’s a very preppy clean cut kid. Although I’m just about as tall as he is and weigh much more, he’s actually quite physically strong and could probably kick my ass. The first time I noticed him was probably a few months before his 16th birthday, he was already sexually mature by then, the same height but maybe 10 lbs lighter- I was standing behind him at a bonfire, he was wearing his high school jersey and a pair of jeans and couldn’t help notice his cute little butt. I never thought much about it but I suspect over the last year or so he became sexually active. He’s a college freshman but lives at home and there were a couple of occasional nights where he went to campus or to a girl’s house and ended up spending the night. One night I woke up to use the bathroom and saw his laundry basket near the dryer. I took out a pair of his underwear (black boxer briefs) and began to sniff them but they were clean. I’ve even gone to the bathroom after he took a dump just to sniff his poop. On occasion I’m the only one home and have been tempted to go into his room and sniff his dirty briefs or hopefully find a used condom and suck the cum out of it…Should I? No one would be the wiser… but I may feel very guilty..then if I don’t I may regret that I didn’t *****Update*** I was working from home today and my stepson had to get to school a day early since he works there part time as well.. A few minutes after he left I found a  pair of  boxer briefs in his bedroom that he just changed. I took a big whiff, especially where his cock and balls would be as well as the crotch… It was incredibly intoxicating… A deep rich musky aroma which I can describe as sheer masculinity, youth, virility and sexuality, unfortunately no cum stains. I didn’t find any used condoms but found an already open box of condoms in his underwear draw as well so he is obviously sexually active which I already suspected. I feel guilty because it seems like not long ago he was just 9 years old and I’m completely disgusted with myself, but then I have to rationalize that he is now almost 19 so I’m glad I satisified my curiosity. I’m glad I wasn’t caught because although he doesn’t look it, he is really strong and would surely kick my ass", category: "a guilt", likes:  4, dislikes:  5)

We both have mental health issues, struggle with depression, anxiety, mood disorders, etc. From the get-go, I took her in with all of her (12) animals and devoted every resource to both her and them, money, time and attention. I gave her everything, quite literally, I’ve fought for this girl for months, even as far as getting kicked out alongside her, just to make sure she had someone at her back. I stuck by her through hellfire. The two of us made a joint homelessness claim and moved into temporary accomodation together, I’ve supported her day in day out, washing her, cleaning up after her, basically acting as her carer, but without claiming any of the benefits. Every penny I’ve had has gone towards her, as well as countless handouts from my obviously reluctant Family, who still continue to support me regardless. We’ve always fought, but today it got physical. She destroyed my mood with belittling comments and in the frustration I took a swipe at her notepad, ripping a page. I felt bad and I made a move to apologise, but she punched my shoulder blades twice, then went for my throat, I’ve got scratches, she tried to throttle me, I had to fight her off. I started screaming at her and got in her face in the heat of it, I did lose control, I was harsh. She headbutted me, burst my nose, I didn’t think, I just reacted, hit back, in the stomach. I knew immediately I shouldn’t have and in that moment all I wanted to do was make sure she was okay, but I just started to pack. Does this make me abusive or was it self defense? I can’t justify my actions, I feel wretched. I’m a lot bigger than she is. TL;DR, gf and I fought, she punched, choked and headbutted me, in response I punched her back.

Secret.create(id: 201161, content: "This is a follow up on 2 confessions.  I’m the gay guy with the obnoxiously alcoholic roommate who very regularly drinks himself into blackouts – but not before driving me crazy acting the fool until he finally does.  I spend the last couple of months of fall term molesting his asshole after he blacked out.  For weeks I would strip him naked and lick, suck, and finger his asshole while I sucked his cock and balls.  I was training his asshole to take my cock and also teaching him to enjoy it.  I took my time coaxing his hole open, training it to eventually accept my cock.  I got very good at forcing him to cum in my mouth while I fingered his prostate. A couple of weeks ago  spring term started and I finally started fucking my cock into his hole.  I was extremely careful at first, not wanting him to wake up sore.  I ate his ass as usual at first, and fingered him open while I sucked his cock.  Using judicious lube and milking his cock to keep him erect I slowly fucked my cock into him just a little at a time.  It was amazing when i finally had my bush parked against his asshole and my cock fully buried.  Barely pumping, I milked him to orgasm and his tight cunt clenching and relaxing around my dick pushed me over the edge.  Though I’d initially planned to wear a rubber it was forgotten in the excitement.  I had to pull out and spray my load all over him to mix with his own load.  I cleaned him very well, even using a warm rag from the bathroom to be sure. I’ve continued to fuck him, but only every few days to give his asshole a chance to recover.  I didn’t want him to be too sore and become suspicious.  So I’ve been gently with his new pussy.  I always eat and finger his hole first,  keeping his cock hard as I do.  He’s become very responsive, his cock throbs and leaks precum.  Though mostly out of it, he’s become vocal with grunting and moaning while my dick fucks his hole.  i’m so familar with his new cunt that I created, I can almost just use my cock to keep him hard with massaging it with my gentle thrusts.  I love forcing him to spray cum all over his belly and chest with my cock.  I always pull out while he’s spraying and add my load to his.  I clean him judiciously after, removing all trace of our orgasms. His asshole is my cunt now, and it has changed dramatically since that first time I tasted it in the fall term.  A tiny button hole then, it’s now taking on the characteristics of a pussy. Instead of a buttonhole, it now appears to be a small slit.   It is extremely exciting to watch it grow a little more with every fuck session.  The thick hair he had around his hole also seems to be thinning, making it appear even more cunt-like. If he has noticed yet any of the changes I’m causing by using his hole for a pussy, he hasn’t let on.  No changes in behavior  yet either.  He still manages to get his shit done during the day – attends class religiously, spends a few hours completing assignments, then begins drinking like a fish and being annoying as fuck while doing it.  I bare it a lot better than in the beginning – hell, sometimes I even encourage it if he doesn’t seem to be heading for his blackout stage.  Probably because I can’t wait for him to fucking pass out so I can get in that sweet little cunt again. My behavior has changed toward him, however.  I’m a lot friendlier toward him and engage him while drinking to encourage him.  I’m a lot more physical with him lately, too.  He’s a friendly drunk and loves to hug.  I return those with gusto now and bear hug him.  I’m a lot more open with nudity now, also.  I think nothing of walking around nude when I get out of the shower and while he doesn’t acknowledge it it thrills me to show him to the cock I’ve built his new pussy with. He went home for the weekend to visit his family and my cock is throbbing missing his sweet ass.  He’ll be home tonight and I can’t wait.  I’ve restocked the fridge with his favorite beer and I’ll be pulling out the bourbon as well. I think tonight, instead of pulling out to spray my load onto his, I’m going to shoot my load deep into his cunt.  I want to keep my cock there as my cum marinates his hole until i finally get soft enough to slip out of him naturally.  Potentially, it’s likely I will harden again and want to fuck again before that happens. It’s about time he becomes a proper cum dump.", category: "a guilt", likes:  8, dislikes:  3)

Secret.create(id: 201147, content: "I need to confess what I have done with regard to my addiction to pornography which escalated over a period of years resulting in me wasting thousands of dollars and doing shameful things. OK so first of all I have been addicted to porn for at least 7 years. Nothing too extreme or debauched but a lot of typical porn featuring women with unrealistic enhanced bodies. I became obsessed with tanned white female pornstars with big soft fake lips and huge fake tits and would masturbate at least daily watching them. I had traumatic teenage years at an all boys school and struggled with the opposite sex because of low self-esteem from being bullied, I therefore had a lot of sexual frustration and hypersexual and addictive patterns of behaviour in me even as I later began to have relationships and recover from my addiction as I am now. It escalated when I came across interracial porn, especially ‘blacks on blondes’ including comic/animated interracial ‘black on blondes’ porn. Being a black male myself, I became obsessed with the images of hung black men pounding the sh*t out of tanned blonde pornstars. It became a very overwhelming fetish of mine and I would often be triggered just by seeing a blonde in real life, especially if she had a nice figure, ample bosom and a tan. Not content with watching hours of interracial porn, I eventually succumbed to my desires and bought a life-sized blonde silicone sex doll of ridiculous bodily proportions, but got rid of it after not long. I just couldn’t live with the possibility of it being discovered by a family member in the house. Still, I pressed on and began visiting escorts and pornstars, paying them for their ‘company’. I have visited 11 escorts and pornstars in all, nearly all of them blonde, some of them multiple times. Sometimes I paid extra for them to allow me to film my time with them. On one or two occasions, if they did not offer the extra of filming, I filmed secretly, which gave me a huge rush at the time. Even as I was penetrating these courtesans, fulfilling my ultimate fantasies with these big-breasted, tanned, blonde models, giving them my BBC as hard as I could, I would be impatient to get home and rewatch the videos over and over at my leisure. I would wank myself silly watching those videos and they took a real hold over me. I also once had a steaming hot threesome with two of these lovely buxom callgirls but didn’t manage to film that occasion. I also dabbled heavily in online webcams and stacked up quite a collection of cam2cam sessions with a catalogue of naked blondes as we watched each other. They tended to take a liking to my body which is in decent shape, and my cock which looked even bigger on camera. I would edge and edge until they creamed themselves on their toys and then I would blow my load to finish off. Of course I screen-recorded these sessions for my enjoyment later and I always kept my face hidden. I did all of these things and to this day, although I am now fighting to recover from my porn and sex addiction, I have to battle not to be triggered into relapsing into the above behaviours.", category: "a truth", likes:  3, dislikes:  0)

Until last year, dave & i were partying and he told me he was gonna go into the bedroom and jerk off and i could do the same in the living room, which i certainly was doing, about 15 minutes into it dave comes running out naked and laughing and saying look at me, im huge! And giggled and ran back into the bedroom, i was now so hot i could no longer take it and thought fuck it! I texted him and said why did you leave because i wanted to suck him, and he texted me back and said come back here then! I was in a daze, but lept up and went into the bedroom where he was laying on the bed and was a perfect vision!! Jerking a rock hard now 9.5 inch perfect cock and shaking it at me saying go ahead which of course i did and began slobbering and making love to the perfect cock until he finally exploded down my throat! I was in heaven!! Then a few days later i sucked him again and now about a year later i suck him off about 5 days a week! And tonight i texted him and told him i loved him!! Nobody knows about this but im loving every minute of my beautiful man!!!", category: "a truth", likes:  4, dislikes:  0)

One day, I’m in the cafeteria walking to the vending machine, grabbing myself some barbecue chips, and minding my own business. I have a reputation of befriending teachers in my school, and one of them- I’ll call her Mrs A- is kind of socially awkward, in the sense that she says things that can be taken in weird and inappropriate directions. Usually I don’t pay much attention to it, since I’ve known her for quite a bit now. Back to the story- in the cafeteria, I hear my name shouted from across the entire room full of screaming children. I take my earbuds out, and see Mrs A flailing her arms about like a maniac. I chuckle, watching the eyes of students and teachers alike STARING at us. I didn’t care much for that, and just focused on what Mrs A wanted. She continues talking in a rather loud tone, saying “HEY, (insert name here), ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING THIS WEEKEND? YOU HAVE ANY PLANS? ARE YOU FREE??” Aaaaand everyone started laughing, including my friends who just so happened to stumble upon the situation. Once again, I didn’t care what they thought of me- but Mrs A’s face burned a bright red and she tensed up as she realized what she said. I felt SO bad for her.

I would say it was unrequited love, but even at that age, I wasn’t a fool. I knew that there was something she got me in the first place, she made me look at her and that when I left, I was missed. Not sure at what level, how much, but I was. I know that.

Secret.create(id: 200951, content: "I am going to get married in a couple of months, but I have been having some non-platonic feelings for a guy in my office who is younger than me and has a girlfriend of 6 years. He is almost 6-7 years younger than me. He also sees me almost like an elder sister. A couple of days ago, we went out for drinks after work, all are other friends weren’t available to go, so only the 2 of us went. And I have been soo stressed out because of the coming marriage/wedding that I really needed a break. A couple of drinks down, I just felt soo light, I bared my heart out, giving words to all my worries and tension and telling these to somebody for the first time. We were both having such a good time we didn’t want it to end, so we decided to have a walk, some more conversation.We walked to such random places in the city and spoke about so many things. We laughed so much. We were literally the only ones on the street. We had such a good time. And it was very late by the time we decided we should not be out for any longer. Going back to my place was a little difficult for me since I hadn’t told my roommate I would be late and she would have locked the door thinking I would be at office tonight, so this guy offered me to stay at his place, as he had an extra free room. Also, his roommates were out that night. So we took a cab to his place and then we stayed up till 5 while chatting more about stuff, life and all. The conversation was great, truly uninhibited one. But he kept saying please feel comfortable, you have come to your brother’s place. As in he does make such statements often. Then we decided to go to sleep when it was almost dawn. I went to sleep in his roommates’ room with a double bed while he was going to sleep in his own room. After I set up my bed, he said will you be scared of sleeping alone, though I said no, he still said, ‘it’s alright, i’ll get my stuff’. I know I should have protested probably, but I didn’t, so he came over on the other side of the bed and we lied down. I have no idea whether he fancies me at all, because he keeps saying i’m like his sister, but the sexual tension i felt through the night, i was soo wet, and fell asleep and woke up so many times in anticipation of something might happen. Nothing happened though, thankfully, else things would have been soo messed up. Our feet touched a few times, though I don’t know how cause we had separate blankets. However, there was this moment – he held my fingers and commented on something on my hand, turned over my hands a few times and then kept holding it loosely, I got conscious and scooped my hands out of his hands, the strange part was he was still kinda holding my hand. For obvious reasons i asked him not to tell about this night to anyone, including his girlfriend. He was like she won’t think anything of it, could have even if you were my age but you are way older, just way older for anything happening between us, but it felt like he was telling himself more than me – or maybe that’s what I want to think. Well in any case, it was a great night and I am quite glad nothing happened that we would regret. I felt soo free after a very long time, but the added bonus was i was out with him. He said i look really cute when i smile..", category: "a truth", likes:  2, dislikes:  0)

I wish pregnancy and the more gentle, caring aspects of parenthood weren’t seen as things strictly for women. I really want to carry/ nurse my future children (not that parents that can’t do those things aren’t any less valid, they are just experiences I want to experience as I am lucky enough to do so) but I don’t want people taking my gender identity less seriously just because I want to have a bio-child in the way that I am capable.

Secret.create(id: 200785, content: "Are white American males members of a defeated people? One could certainly argue that going from a majority status to a minority status in a democracy is a defeat, but even if it weren’t, it is easy to see how the sociological expression of a defeated people could readily apply to white people in 2019 America. The Southern Poverty Law Center taught me in 2000 just how defeated white people are. I had started an organization in New York that put up billboards containing information about mass immigration that the people were not getting from the media. A typical message, for example, would state that within our lifetimes, according to Census Bureau data, immigration will double the population of the United States. As a result of our billboard campaign, everyone went insane. Among other excesses, Congressman Joe Crowley, my representative in Congress, called the billboards “loathsome”; a group of rabbis protested in front of a billboard in Queens; The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart ridiculed me on Comedy Central and used a photo of me with a Hitler mustache superimposed; TV crews camped outside the homes and businesses of family members; politicians held press conferences denouncing the “hate” the billboards spread; the New York City Council voted 43-2 to condemn ProjectUSA and, at a news conference after the vote, I was compared to a self-described neo-Nazi who had shot up a Jewish daycare center in Los Angeles and murdered an Asian postal worker the day before; New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, writing in the Jewish Forward, inveighed against “the putrid stench of Nelsen’s racism”; billboard companies—after threats from city officials—broke their contracts and took down ProjectUSA billboards. The SPLC joined in the public hysteria, denouncing me and ProjectUSA and implying in its “Intelligence Report” that the billboards were “racist”. Most damaging and outrageously unfairly, the SPLC used its well-honed skills at character assassination to link ProjectUSA and me to “Nazi atrocities”. In one illustrative incident, New York’s Fox 5 TV station contacted me, requested an interview, and asked whether I could also bring along some “followers”. I agreed and brought two local supporters, both of whom had contributed money to the billboard campaigns. One was an African-American man from Brooklyn, who understood the downward pressure on wages mass immigration put on the teens and low income workers in his neighborhood. The other was an immigrant from India, who was most concerned about the massive fraud that occurs in the immigration industry. As the cameras were being set up, the two ProjectUSA supporters were telling the reporter, Mary Garofalo, why they felt the country needed an immigration time-out. Interrupting, she pointed at me, saying, “Look, I understand why he’s here. What I don’t understand is why you are here.” In other words, Garofalo couldn’t even hear the words coming out of their mouths. The only pertinent fact to her was their skin color. By these and other experiences, I learned that immigration is, for many, including Mary Garofalo, absolutely a racial issue. This raised an interesting question: if the immigration issue is absolutely a racial issue, then what are the racial reasons for Mary Garofalo’s support for mass immigration, or Dov Hikind’s, or Jon Stewart’s, or the Southern Poverty Law Center’s? From my experience with ProjectUSA and the vicious attacks—including attacks from the SPLC—on me and my group some twenty years ago, I have come to believe that a debilitating, spirit-sapping bigotry against whites permeates the culture. While the National Association of La Raza openly advocates for Latino interests, the Anti-Defamation League openly advocates for Jewish interests, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People openly advocates for African-American interests—all without the slightest censure—the completely race-neutral ProjectUSA had been attacked viciously by the SPLC as a racist organization. The other groups made no secret of their racial activism, indeed, were rewarded for it with grants from the Ford Foundation and federal and state governments. Meanwhile, we were attacked for SECRETLY advocating for the interests of whites! So I came up with a program to help those men in distress. It was a 13-week residency program that included exercise, a healthy diet, a rigorous academic program that included philosophy, poetry, math, literature, and, contra Hollywood, history. But the core of the program was daily intensive boxing training. While the program was designed to address the particular challenges unique to white males, the program–always clearly stated–was open to men of any race experiencing personal distress. A friend I’d known for years thought my idea worth a try. He had an 8,000 sq ft empty grocery store in his small hometown of Lexington, Missouri. He put the grocery store at my disposal to see whether I could make the program work. A friend and I went to Lexington. As we began to clean up the old grocery store, there were some questions on the local Facebook group about the program, but then a local woman named Deborah Starke Bulloc found the old Southern Poverty Law Center smear against me from 2000 and posted it on the group’s Facebook page. And everyone went insane. It was hardly necessary, but the SPLC got wind of our effort and writer Stephen Piggott reworked the old smear into a new attack, which was written so as to leave readers believing we were opening a whites-only club in Lexington, Missouri. That was the end of our effort and this marvelous opportunity that could have helped so many families. In the wake of the SPLC’s attack, our Kickstarter campaign was shut down, the city issued a “stop work” order, the owner of the grocery store withdrew his support, and, if I was walking my dog, passengers in passing cars would roll down their windows and scream, “Get out, Nazi! We don’t want your **** here”. In November, I filed a $4.755 million defamation suit against the SPLC in the US District Court for the Western District of Missouri, and against Morris Dees, Richard Cohen, Heidi Biereich, and the author, Stephen Piggott (who appears to have been fired just about the time the summonses were served on the SPLC). They have a half billion dollars in assets, more than a hundred attorneys on staff, and have hired a major DC law firm and a Kansas City law firm to go against me. I’m filing pro se, en forma pauperis. And I’m going to win.

Don’t even think about it. I’m a female and when I was in my teens all of my friends had boyfriends and were experimenting sexually with their boyfriends and they would share their activities with the rest of us. I’m not a pretty girl. Boys weren’t asking me out. I didn’t have a date until I was 20. I used to masturbate but that wasn’t enough and I wanted to feel what it was like to have sex. I started trying things I could find around the house even food. I had to  do what I could with what was available because I didn’t want my parents to know and there was no way for me to get to a store on my own or order anything online to the house. This is the really messed up part. One day I was home alone and I tried to do it with the dog. I wasn’t able to the first time I tried and I hated myself for even trying. But about a week later I tried again and still wasn’t able to. I kept trying and I was able to do the right things to him and get into the right position and was able to do it. Anyone that says that they just bent over and fucked their dog is lying. It wasn’t easy and took quite a while to get right. I thought to myself finally I did it. I got laid and finally had sex. I felt pathetic and was very depressed after. The only thing that would have sex with me was a dog and that took a while to do. I felt like such a loser and was disgusted with myself. I vowed never to do it again. I thought I just needed to experience sex and I’d be okay. I tried to not even masturbate. But after a week I was masturbating again and I tried to keep it to just that. The dog kept sniffing around me even in front of my family. He seemed to know when I was horny and was especially nosy then. I ended up doing it with him again and it eventually became a regular thing. I know on this site its not a big deal but it changed me forever. I’m damaged in ways I couldn’t have imaged. I don’t feel good enough for a relationship and I live in fear I might slip one day. I keep it inside and have never told anyone what I did and I guess thats why I’m here.

A girlfriend he loved dearly also walked out of his life between those incidents. He still feels hurt and talks about her. He became very depressed and increasingly negative. Any advice or offer of assistance to help was met with excuses and reasons why it wouldn’t work. He lashes out at me and complains often about his life but isn’t willing to do anything about it. He’s in this odd state of learned helplessness and arrested development (lacking the tools to navigate his life into adulthood). His negativity drags me down, tbh. It’s draining. I walk on eggshells when we hangout or talk because anything could trigger him unintentionally.

I got one so big on my cunt that you could have boiled it and seasoned it with some spice and had yourself a hell of a meal. I contracted those crabs from the prom king. He fucked me in the limo after he accepted his award. He told me he wanted to fill my slot with unprotected cock, that way he could give me his crabs. I thought he was goofing around, but he was dead serious and loving every minute of it. Within a week, crabs had infested my cunt. Every inch of my fuckbucket was covered with those nasty little vermin entitled crabs. Sometimes they would bite my clit and it would feel great, but most of the time it was horrible and made me feel inferior. I didnt know how to get rid of them and I didnt have health insurance so I lived with them for 10 years and 3 days. I tried sitting in tomato juice but I heard later that was used for getting rid of skunk stench. So I figured if you cant beat em, join em. I named every single crab that had moved onto the surface of my snatch. As far as I could feel, there was 20. Raymond, Lupe, Bobby, Ernest, Dixie, Lawrence, Shirley, Steve, Alejandro, and Neche. Eventually, after I had saved up some cash, I turned my attention to a doctor, who helped me kill the crabs. At the time I was happy to be free from their constant biting, but then became suicidal because I had killed my friends that had been by my side for 10 years. Even when I would go out for a weekend of unprotected fucking, they wouldnt leave me. They believed in me. Not one of the peters that pulverized my pussy during my 10 years of crab infestation contracted them. They stuck by my poontang through thick and thin, and I feel deeply in love with them and they loved me. At night, I command them to bite my clitoris while I plugged my urine hole with a home pregnancy test. They wouldnt stop biting until all the tartar sauce had evacuated my twitty twat. They were my lovers, and I destroyed their sweet hearts. Volley ball took away the depression of the crab killing, and that is the real reason that im forever grateful for the game. I was this close to bringing the curtain down. So you want to know what the word ‘crab’ means to me? It means love of a lifetime. I hope before I die that another crab carrying cock will dose me up good with a good dosage of crabs, so I can know once again what it feels like.", category: "a wild experience", likes:  5, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 200469, content: "I have a sexual relationship with the Nintendo character, Mario. I’m even a male. It began by me just gazing at a picture of Mario for straight up 5 minutes, seeing how handsome he is. I thought this was off and tried to shake it off but the attraction stayed. Soon, gazing at these photos started to give me boners. So I started to masturbate to Rule 34 drawings but always found myself cumming at drawings of Mario. This gotten so deep, I wrote fanfictions of us together and tried lucid dreaming. But two weeks ago, it finally happened. I realized I was dreaming, and summoned Mario, which worked. The first encounter involved us talking and flirting, and I apparently told him to tell me I was dreaming each time I was dreaming and to come see me. A few days after, Mario always appeared in my dreams and told me I was dreaming. The second encounter we went to his house and immediately got into it. I stripped him down, and was shocked to see his at least 8-inch dic*, and immediately started blowing. After that, we fucked each other, rubbed our dicks together, and cuddled. It was AMAZING. Mario told me ever since we met, he’d oil his dick every night to make it oiler, tastier, and shinier. His dick tasted like pasta, and the cum tasted like alfredo sauce. So far, our relationship is going well, and pretty steamy.", category: "a fantasy", likes:  2, dislikes:  3)

Secret.create(id: 200465, content: "So…I had a weird dream fairly recently. I’ve had the same dream about 3 times now, for the past week. I’m not sure if it’s just my mind creating something random, or if it means something. So lemme tell you about it. (TLDR WARNING)(Also another note, this entire dream was REALLY slow. Like a slow motion part of a movie) The dream started a bit blurry. A bunch of red and blue lights flashing in whatever I could see past the water in my eyes. I’m on the concrete, laying there, doing nothing. I decide to stay low, not knowing what I might get into. As my eyes beam from left to right, I see cops, wearing black and blue…Running. I see cops all running in one direction, hopping over cars, shooting behind them, some yelling. My ears were ringing, from all the noise around me. I stayed down as cop after cop ran past me. Hopeless, no idea what was to happen to me. Eventually, there were none left running past me. I begin to get off the concrete I had been laying on, and look around me. As I do so, I hear a piano start playing, alongside some ambient synths, which changed its frequency every time I turned my head. Every footstep I took triggered some sort of bass drum beat. I naturally walk in tempo, down the street I was laying on. I walked in the opposite direction that I saw cops running, towards a tall building. Eventually some cops came, pointing a gun at me, and yelling. However, I figured out very quickly that if I stomp, they float off the ground and fall back violently, followed by a more booming drum sound. I entered the building, greeted by gunshots from men in suits. I stomped again. This time, windows shattered, bullets blew up midair, and of course, the men in suits dropped really quickly. I eventually I began working my way up a staircase. As I walked up, the background noises started to crescendo, and wind noises began transitioning the music from part to part. Eventually I got to the top, a door. As I opened the door, a cyan glow started cracking it’s way through, alongside what sounded like a cymbal roll, which ended once the door was fully open. As I walked past the door, the music in the background was loud, and climatic, with all sorts of instruments blasting every note. The wind blew harshly, as I looked up to the sky. What I saw in the sky still impacts me every time I think about it. A giant, blue star. The star was giant, right next to the atmosphere. But I could see the top of it! However, it was interacting with me. The music, this weird rhythmic stomping power. It was all coming from the star! I stomp one more time…But the dream ends. Thanks for reading through this, and if ANY sort of meaning comes to you, let me know!", category: "a dream", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

She quickly went to find the teacher and started stamping her little feet on the floor and squealing at the top of her lungs. It annoyed everybody, and she as already getting picked on for being annoying. I spent the next few days bullying her. I pushed her to the floor. I pulled her hair. I got her in submission holds. I encouraged the other girls to pick on her. They threw paint in her hair. She was repeatedly humiliated by the entire peer group and she developed sleep issues and bed-wetting issues. One time she wanted to kill a turtle that one of the nursery teachers brought in. I smacked her for it and she was literally screaming and crying in absolute terror. When the other girls followed me to the reading corner she had to follow them because she didn’t want to be left on her own with the boys. One of the girls pushed her into a bookshelf and she fell on the floor with it. She made a wailing noise, in confusion, and then one of the boys sneaked up on her and put her in a cruel wrestling hold. She wailed and cried loudly until the teacher rescued her. She went onto be universally hated and despised because she wanted to be too special and she wanted too much attention. People found pleasure in inflicting misery upon her.", category: "a guilt", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

I had to leave teaching because I couldn’t keep my hands off the young girls and eventually I was afraid I’d get caught and sent to jail… I have a regular office job now and I haven’t put my hands on a teenage girl in 6 years… which is the statute of limitations in Arkansas … but I still pine for young teenage girls even as I get older and older …. mainly because I want them pregnant My teenage pregnancy fetish has festered and grown worse. I now actively desire for girls to get pregnant as teenagers – even though it’s always a moving goal post for me. but I know it’s an elusive and dangerous cycle Is this normal?  Is this ok for me to want? Not just for myself – but I actively WANT other teenage girls to get pregnant! Any teenage girl I see I think: wouldn’t it be better if she was pregnant! When I see a young teenage girl who is pregnant I am floored and I adore her. It’s hard to know for sure, but I hope it didn’t look odd for a middle aged man like me (I’m nearly 40 but I look much much older due to hard living and hard drinking as a chronic alcoholic and a longtime heavy cigarette smoker, I could easily pass for 45 to 50+) It seemed so peculiar for Me to love all pregnant teenage girls… but then I started reading about it online In some way, isn’t older men with teenage girls what nature intended?isnt that what evolution pushed humanity towards?  For men to be older and established and women to be young teens with maximum fertility? I’m established now. I have a steady job and an apartment and a paid for car and all that. It’s evolutionary biology – I’m established and can provide for children – therefor it makes sense for a young fertile teenage girl to have children with me Wasn’t It normal in the Bible? Wasn’t it normal even until the late 1800s? I did some genealogy online, and found an ancestor of mine who married at 33, to a 16 year old girl and then when she died giving birth to their 3rd child in 1880, he remarried the next year at age 39 to a 15 year old girl and they had 6 more children Apparently that was totally normal back then… everyone’s family is going to have instances of guys in their 30s or 40s marrying and having children with 15 year old girls … in fact it’s hard to find any records from the 1800s of men who weren’t having children with women between the ages of 15 to 19, at least the first children, and the women then had children throughout the rest of their twenties – but they always started with teenage pregnancy So what changed?

Secret.create(id: 200283, content: "This is my depression.I have depression bc of my insecurity and self esteem issues,its on my face.Because of it,i had so many problems in my life. I was an extrovert,i had a lot of friends since i started school. On 7th grade,almost all of my classmates are my friends until someone pointed out that i look like freak with my mole,and everyone laughed at me since then i started feeling like ugly.On 8th grade,a guy made fun of me,bullied me;the worst thing he did to me was when he pulled my hair and threathened me like he said something and said “do you understand ugly?” it was very shameful.The other boys made fun of me also and calling me names,and when i came home i was depressed and dont know what to do,and i didnt go to class the next day.I had so many absences.But i still had friends that time,i think like 7 people. On 9th grade,i only had one friend,who’s my only real best friend,she’s also was my bestfriend in 7th grade.She’s the only one i trusted,and the only one who’s been in my home,watch movie etc.On 10th grade,i felt less ugly bc i had removed my mole with an apple cider vinegar.I know its crazy,but it worked.But i didnt have real friends anymore and i felt alone.At almost end of the semester,i was really alone.I was jealous of the popular girl in my class,she had a bestfriend and the whole class liked her. No one likes to talk to me.I was still bullied by an asshole in the class. On 11th grade,my mole was kinda visible,so i tried removing it again and i messed it up,it came back and i felt ugly again.I never taken a pic of myself,in my phone i have no pic of myself.I have deleted  my social medias bc of it.I became isolated,became away from other people and think only myself.On 11th grade,i transferred to a new school,which is a really bad school.It has bad reviews on it lol. I always been scared to go to a new school,bc i have to adjust but that time i was proud of my self to go to a new school. I had no real friends there. Well,i have two friends but they are not the “permanent” friends,we only are friends inside the class but thats also temporary,sometimes we dont talk to each other. The first friend,is also like me,she has insecurity and self esteem issues.She has a lot acnes,like really alot and big ones but her imperfections are more than that.I feel really bad for her bc i know what she feels everyday she goes to school,she really stick with me bc she felt alone,like she always go with me and follow me and she’s been made fun of and to be honest,her issues are worse than me. The second girl,i like her bc we have common to each other,we both dont like going to school so when there’s a program in the school,we look at each other and goes like “are you going?” “No” “lets both dont go” and we both laugh.But she has a bestfriend and we cant be real friends.I was really alone in the 11th grade,no one likes me like tbh i can feel it,everyone avoided me and when i ask them they dont really like to respond.I had a girl who’s in the same class and neighbor too which is good for friendship but we never really been friends.I was considered,the most quiet one in the class.I was the only one who’s quiet there like for real,i like to sat on the corner where the teacher cant seen me or im not really can be seen.But thr thing i appreciate is they never pointed out the flaw on my face and are very mature about it.I kinda sound desperate for friendship but i actually prefer to not have one while i have my flaw,i got used to having fun with myself. I always ask myself “why me?” there’s people out there,who has bad intentions to everyone,who are criminals etc but WHY.ME?.Could i ever be out of this misery?. When i go to school and step out of my house i feel like entering hell. On the upcoming 2nd semester,i focus of my insecurity to get rid of it but somehow i failed,you have no idea how many times ive done the “getting rid of it” on my mole and still failed and cry bc its still there,the roots are still there. there’s just failures and things not going right until the 2nd sem. is back and still have it on my face. On the night,i cant sleep bc i have very bad insomnia,i was still up at 3am with my phone,i set up my alarm to 6:30am and the only time i left for sleep is 3 hours,so i decided not to sleep.i message my schoolmate and she said shes going there at 6 so i immediately took a shower and put on my uniform,i didnt eat and sleep,nice way of killing yourself. I was nervous and my stomach doesnt feel right so i chilled down for some minutes in my room with door open,the sun light shines through me,it was nice to see sunlight again.I dont like being late bc there’s so much things to do when i got there,too much hassle,But i also had an axiety attack and i was really scared to step out.So i decide to go to school the next day,i  got on my feet,shut the door and the sunlight replaced with darkness in my room again,i removed my uniform and wore a coat and shoot up the school lmfao just kidding😂.thats kinda not funny anyway,i went to sleep,i woke up to my mom open my door and ask “you didnt even eat once today?” I ignored her and check on my phone,its 5pm and i cried. I was very depressed to the point,i have to stop school. I never knew i could come to this point in my life. I never experienced this,my school are just straight;no failures or anything but now i have to stop bc i cant do it anymore. My brother is always 1st honorable,athletic,sociable etc. but me,just stereotypical depressed artist whos always on my room.I keep on finding a way of getting rid of this problem but i cant. This mole shit stops me from dreaming,becoming a normal person with normal life.I really like fashion and dressing up but when i want to but clothes,theres always a thing coming out of my mind “dont waste you time in this,it doesnt fit you” “you face doesnt come with your fashion” or even hygiene ffs like “think about your problem first” “whats the point of this if youre still ugly” its always on my mind. My depression even affected my meals,”why eat?” “Theres no point of eating,youre still ugly”. A lot of people dont understand this,and just says “get over it”,huh i hope its that easy people,i hope. People who never suffers this would never understand,just respect it,its like me not understanding people who go with their partners after the cheated bc “they love them” and i still respect their decision.I dont know whats gonna happen to me next. I tried saving up to go to a dermatologist,but i cant work bc of it,damn i cant even go to school. So i just work on a website creating contents and making money.But the earnings are really small. My mom did so much sacrifice for me but here i am. Its so fucking hard.

Well, tonight, after 2 days of no sleep, being high on amphetamine and weed, and absolutely horny as hell, I did something about it. I cruised a rest area bathroom. I got there at about 1130 PM or so. I parked and scanned the lot. Not anything going on. I went into the restroom to check it out. I went back to my car and watched gay porn for about 30 minutes. Then, at midnight, it was like the most happening spot to be. I went back into the restroom. This time, there were like 5 guys in it. I went into one of the stalls and left the door cracked. I dropped my pants and sat on the toilet. Now, these toilets, all of them, have extra long bowls and 3 sets of handrails. So, I sort of nestled in and began stroking my cock. I was getting quite hard, and I heard footsteps going back and forth. This would be it. I could tell there was still another person in the bathroom. So the dude pacing was probably waiting for the other dude to leave. Finally, I hear the other guy leave. Then, I look up, and the guy is watching me jerk off. He asks if I want help. I tell him yeah and to get into the stall. He said he wanted to suck my dick. So, he sat on the toilet, and I stood in front of him. I can tell he’s admiring my freshly shaved cock and balls. Finally, he takes my dick into his mouth. He starts sucking it. Lightly, sort of at first. Then he really got into it and next thing I know, I’m telling him I’m cumming. He takes every drop, swallows, and thanks me. I thank him, and go ahead and get out. WOW, my mind is just spinning.", category: "a fantasy", likes:  2, dislikes:  0)

I would consider not posting something like this but there is something that is preventing the world crypto market from functioning correctly because it wants to control it because it has more money than everyone. Granted, yes it does have more money than any one group or person, but when it has to deal with the world, since everyone is different and has to sleep / has different finances / etc, it just doesn’t really line up. When this problem gets fixed or that “thing” decides to learn or stop -or- goes to jail the world will probably become more mentally stable and happier. Not many folks talk about this because cryptocurrency is shady and nerdy however it influences folks opinions.  Not only that but if you piss off a thousand millionaires by getting in the way and not letting the market be natural the world becomes a worse place.

In one moment My world disappeared Why?  When?  How? Nothing I ever knew makes sense Gravity suddenly fails me. I’m left floating in a world of confusion Then it hits The ache The pain The anger I feel everything and nothing all at once The questions The doubt What did I do wrong? What’s wrong with me? Am I not lovable? What did he have that I didn’t? WHAT’S WRONG WITH ME?? Everything I knew about myself is gone The small gestures of love?     Not enough My efforts as a father?     Not enough My undying love and support?     Not enough I’m not attractive enough I don’t love enough I’m simply…. not enough But HE is. How could I have missed it? When did I miss it?     every text     every trip to the store     every phone call     every night spent on your phone How many more were there? Every single memory is now shrouded in doubt No happy memories are left untainted Even the paternity of my baby girls isn’t without some question.  Why should I believe you about that when you lied to my face about affairs before? How fucking hard do you think it’s going to be to carry that suspicion the rest of my life? The numbness sets in. Then the pain intensifies It will never end This is permanent My whole naive view of the world is gone. Forever. The pain intensifies What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you? Are you sorry? Why the hell haven’t you shown remorse or apologized? Do you care?  Did you ever care? Do you know what a mess you’ve made? How could you lie to me and the kids? Did you think about us when you were with him? Did you think about me? Did you think about him when you were with me? Did you talk bad about us? Do you understand that you made me a single parent every time you chose to be with him? I loved you with every ounce of my being. I was sick and acted shitty You let me deal with that alone Then when I was in the darkest time of my entire life You gave your self to someone else Abandoning me Forcing me to try to fight through depression by myself. But yet, I loved you. I would have done anything in the world for you. I literally would have given my life for you if I had the chance. You were my world. Deep down, you know this is true but it wasn’t enough to keep you. It wasn’t enough to persuade you to help me in my pain. It wasn’t enough to give us a chance. He was funnier He was exciting He was dangerous He was MARRIED WITH KIDS Just like you were. Then the lies The fucking lies. You lied about so much for so long What else did you lie about? I love you? In sickness and health? There weren’t any others? You’re going to brunch with the girls? You’re tanning a lot because you like the sun? You just needed new sexy underwear? You “forgot” to wear your ring? You’re going on a trip for work? The anonymous letter was about a co-worker? How can I believe anything you say? Then the self doubt comes in. I no longer trust myself, my judgement, or my perception. How could I have missed something that large for so long? I’ll forever be suspicious of everything. How can I feel lovable when the love of my life chose someone else to give her love to? Was he bigger than me?  Better than me? Do people see a pathetic loser when they see me? Do I not have enough self respect to not beg you to stay after you did this? Will I ever be good enough that someone wants to stay with me when someone better comes along? Am I capable of satisfying anyone? I am not a good judge of character. I am not lovable enough to be someone’s one and only. My innocent, naive, romanticized view of love is shattered and can’t be put back. How can I possibly find love again after this? I’ll forever be suspicious if someone is texting where I can’t see. I will be terrified if she’s “out with the girls” and doesn’t check in. I’ll want to look over at her shoulder when she’s emailing. I’ll constantly be checking up on her social media accounts. Traveling for work is an absolute deal breaker, no matter how perfect she might be. Who wants to be involved with someone like that? Who wants to constantly be doubted? This is ingrained in my being now. I can’t stop it. I can never be at ease and trust someone again. Every relationship will be full of stress and fear. I pray every night that our girls won’t learn that this is normal. I pray that they will somehow be able to open themselves up to love without fear that every man will cheat on them. I pray that they won’t think it’s ok to bail on marriage when they “don’t feel it”. I pray that they won’t leave their family and turn to someone else for comfort. I pray that they can still believe in the fairy tale despite the lessons they’ve been exposed to. Months have passed.  I sometimes think I’m ok. Then I see a Hilton or I see THAT God damned Hilton or your face buried in your phone or the word Chicago or the name John or a love scene on TV It all comes flooding back as painful as the day that the fucking phone ruined my life. I have to relive the entire experience from start to finish with the same intensity. I still cry almost every day. I don’t cry about our marriage anymore. God knows I don’t cry over you. I cry because I know that I’ll never fully heal. I cry because everything I loved about love is a pipe dream. I cry because there is no such thing as ’till death do us part.’ I cry because I can never tell my babies what happened and how hard I tried to save our family. I cry because they’ll love mommy more than me until they’re old enough to learn the truth. I can never tell you how I feel or how badly you hurt me. What good would it do? You aren’t interested in repairing any part of our relationship. A simple, face-to-face, sincere “I’m Sorry” would have done wonders But you aren’t sorry about being with him and probably never will be. I’m left carrying this by myself.

Secret.create(id: 200159, content: "My partner and I have been together for a while (8years?) and this feeling has never left me.  Whenever we go to visit his family, I feel tossed aside.  Now listen, I realize he has not seen his family in a few months and I don’t get in the way of him seeing them, if anything I encourage it but when we are there (and keep in mind this is not intentional on his part, he is just very.. thoughtless? about these things?) when we are there he does not engage with me or try to make me comfortable. So Okay sure, I can make myself comfortable but it’s just sort of embarrassing for me, in front of his family, for them to see how he treats me around them but I kind of smile and shrug it off in front of them like that’s just how we are as a couple.  Does that make sense? I’ve tried to talk to him about this maybe like once, but when he hears anything he doesn’t like he get very defensive and we cannot come to a conclusion.  It turns into, ‘well you do this!’ and he says things that I do wrong which aren’t even relevant to the original conversation.  It’s to the point where I’ve accepted being tossed aside at family gatherings as a normal thing but the thought still lingers in my mind every single time. I thought maybe it’s just his culture or how his family is, but his siblings don’t show the same distance to their partners in front of their parents, so I’m feeling a bit less than – I don’t know, worthy? I feel like I don’t belong when I am there and I don’t want to feel like I’m forcing myself onto them either. On top of all that awkwardness I have a sister in law who likes to trash talk about me to the family.  My partner and I live in a different city from his family so we are not around as often as they are.  I am a ‘heathen’ who will not ‘accept’ her religion.  I kid you not she thinks I’m the freaking antichrist and I have not done ANYTHING to her other than have an open conversation about religion ONCE(that SHE brought up), and she was so upset that I would not say some certain words of her faith. Sometimes I wonder if this is even right.  Sometimes I find myself thinking, I just don’t belong here.  Then I think, well if the family was more loving to me would I feel different about our relationship?  Would I have these thoughts of ‘can I do this? for the rest of my life?’ or would I feel more relieved like they are just hiccups along the way? Is this a normal feeling with in laws? My partner treats me well.  He supports me and my lifestyle.  He says he loves me.  We are not married and are without kids.  Yet I feel so selfish for even thinking ‘Could someone love me more?  Could I be happier?  Am I happy?’ Of course I’m happy.. I don’t have to worry financially, my sex needs are met, I have a home, food.  He comes home everyday.. where I sit and wait… everyday.  I don’t see or talk to any of my old friends anymore.  I get onto social sites every now and then, but even then I just watch.  If he found out I was talking to someone, he would have to know their name, gender and why I’m talking to them. The thought scares me… I don’t know if this relationship counts as abuse to the both of us, but just having the mere thoughts that I do and by having that questioning feeling, I can’t help but feel like something might be wrong here. But again, I feel selfish for even considering it. I should stop these silly thoughts to support and love him regardless.. right?", category: "a random feeling", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

I got away from her. I just told my probation officer this morning and he said he was going to overlook one infraction because he does not want me to go back to jail because I take care of my younger brother (22) who has down syndrome. I also go to college part time with the goal of maybe opening a restaurant business one day. Now, you people who call me the scum of the Earth, I already know I am. I have no self esteem at all, no confidence, like I said, I don’t even feel like I’m a person anymore- just a thing to be used and abused. I am so thankful to this woman who offered me free cosmetic surgery- it may boost my confidence and get me on track again. Everytime I look at my penis or touch my anal area while wiping or washing, I won’t feel those huge scars from my abuse and maybe I won’t be traumatized each time. I am putting my search for a wife on hold for the time being while I go to counseling and get my life in order. That lady offering free plastic surgery may well have saved my life last night. I was just going to end all my pain and suffering- but I thought if I did that who would look after my brother? I’m just 30 years old, I want to marry and have a family, buy a house and see the world. I’m not a monster even though I feel like it sometimes. When my victim becomes an adult, I want to personally apologize to her. There is no fucking excuse as to what I did to her and I don’t even know why I did it. I will explore that in counselling as well. Lastly, at the time I committed my crime at 23, I had over $50,000 saved from just my labors- I worked part time since I was nine years old doing everything from washing cars to cleaning up dog poop. I saved every cent. It was going to be used for my brother’s care. The young girl I raped needed a major surgery to save her uterus from the damage I caused. She didn’t have insurance and her parents were on the poor side. Her family got an annonymous donation of 47,000 to cover the full cost of her surgery and follow up care for a year. No one will ever know it was from me. I did not even tell my parents. This young lady will have the opportunity to be a mom and hold and infant one day while her proud husband looks on. For my future, I just wish I could find one woman who will treat me kindly despite all the harm I caused.", category: "a guilt", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

Well, our relationship has become more of a commitment and there is hardly any love left. Also, I never feel wanted, it mostly feels like I’m taken for granted and am expected to be a certain way, and do certain things. I’m the only girl in my workplace so I mostly hang out with a bunch of guys who are quite younger than me, say 6-8 years, also because they are in my team. I have always seen them as kids, young blood and all. But of recent, I have been feeling strangely attracted to one of the guys. I am not sure why this sudden change of heart when even a few weeks before everthing was perfectly platonic. Also, he has a girlfriend of almost 5 years. I feel so ashamed of having these feelings and some fleeting daydreams about it/him, it simply embarrasses me.

Secret.create(id: 200013, content: "I am about to get married to my boyfriend of 3.5 years in about a month. No, things are not at all ok, there is no love left, we are very different from each other, our cultures are different, but our families are similar. But I don’t love him anymore. Why am I getting married? Because I’m of marriage age, my parents are growing old and worried about my future, and if I get married to a nice guy and nice family and settle down, it will make them happy. I am not against marriage, I want to settle down to, but I wish I had dated more, got to know more guys instead of just staying committed for the heck of it. This relationship has been like hell at times to be honest, but it’s the movies to blame how they romanticise pain and heartbreak. I remember having cried everyday for over a 2 years, only now that I have grown nonchalant about the incidents. But the constant fights and arguments, and neglect have both let me down and broken me so much so that it feels like a lifetime ago when I was truly happy. The pain had grown so much sometimes I had even contemplated ending my life as an escape. I couldn’t, I wouldn’t; there are people who love me immensely, I breathe each moment for them. But nothing matters now. Now it’s just that I have known him for a good some time, his family is good, our economic statuses match, and honestly speaking seeing most men my age already married, my chances of finding someone if I started looking now are super slim. So this is a sacrifice, an adjustment, but a commitment I have made so I’ll keep it. Pray, I stay strong, I survive.", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

Comment.create(content: 'please, at least wait until your daughter is a number of years older – age twelve to have parents divorce is just shattering. that’s the age when you’re especially needing a father figure, and a whole family to support you in the transitioning years. it could alter stuff , like how she views life, adult role models and guys, relationships, even stability… I could go on 🙁 (and I’m not even going to touch on what it would affect and alter with you present wife)   …but maybe your daughter has a lot of resilience; maybe she’s a realist. you know. but it depends on how she views you and your wife…  just make sure you really think about your daughter, please – If this new woman is as kind and nice as you say she is, then she’ll still be that way in a number of years! just saying and hey, if you have something real with your wife right now, don’t take that lightly, even as ridiculous as that sounds. This new woman will have her own issues! I think we all know everyone does. it might not be noticeable now, but it’ll come; the new problems. yeah updated problems…it’s just life, something you have to get used to. we all have to put up with and go through certain really tough and hard stuff with people we form close attachments with – it can be really straining. But ‘the grass is always greener’ will always be the ‘perfection’ just beyond us, always calling to us, always wanting us to follow. Yeah, then we learn the hard way that the greener side doesn’t actually exist. and, yeah, we’d like…no we’d love to think we won’t always have this tough relational stuff someday. it’s like we can’t get that blissful ‘perfection’ out of our heads and see everybody as having both good and bad; man, I’ve had issues with that too And yeah, you have to figure this out on your own. you know your values. you’ll have to make a decision that is aligned with what you truly believe about hope, life, the lives of your family and this new woman, and about what you think what a state of ‘happiness’ really is. Yes, everyone’s got their own idea of this stuff, but know that what you’re deciding is really aligned with your deepest values and core beliefs about life and relationship.', secret_id: 205933)
Comment.create(content: 'P.S.: sometimes appreciate and remember those good things in your life to remember why the wife you have now and your daughter mean a lot to you, deep down (yes I can see it in what you wrote, clear as day) – I had this random experimental idea: if do one sweet/nice thing for your wife every day (even if it’s unappreciated sometimes and even if it’s something just small – like buying her a tiny but favourite snack or talking with her about a favourite happy memory), or every other day, and try to see how it goes/how it gives you both joy. Man, I know that’s sounds uhh cheesy, but I really know that talking about the past and telling stories about good memories is something deeper and more foundational to relationships than people give it credit. It’s like the ‘rock’ the ‘foundation’ down underneath all the problems and issues on top.  I mean, we try to ‘make memories’ don’t we? For what?! – to go back to them with somebody! So seriously, you’ll have to do it to see it for yourself. it’s a real test to see what is actually down there with you and your wife – then you can know for sure about stuff/what’s really standing/holding up under everything with you and her.', secret_id: 205933)

Started using Meth as an escape and had a gun in  my mouth about a dozen times one night . that same night i decided i would try everything i could to change just one mind about me . next day i quit the drugs, talked to my ex and my daughter a few days later . it was not easy but all that shit happened last year . Im now engaged to my ex , my  daughter lives with me and im putting together my own company , life is fuckin fantastic and i almost missed out on it all. Dont take the easy way out it will only prove to everyone you were weak. and what if you “miss” and spend the rest of your life pissing into a bag and needing help with every simple function of life. Listen to someone who had it as bad as it can get , you have the power to change anything . So get mad , get sad, then get whatever you want to change how you feel now. wont be easy but it will be so fuckin worth it.', secret_id: 205694)

One 80 year old lady ran after us and broke her hip from a fall. She’s the one that called police. May we talk? I feel like I need someone to talk to. I feel severe guilt over what we did to that elderly woman yet sometimes I feel anger at her that she reported us, because if she never would have, we would have never been arrested and I would not have been raped. I wish I could forget those rapes. The first was the worst. I was 22, and the blood was just dripping out of me and I curled up on the prison mat and cried and cried. No one came to help me. Every time I think of that, I feel intense anger- like I need to get back at someone. Are these normal feelings to have? I would love to talk to you if you have the time. Please, I just want someone to talk to.', secret_id: 205474)
Comment.create(content: 'Sorry, I’m just answering now, the site wouldn’t let me acess it for some reason. And yes, I think those feelings are normal. It’s only natural that you’d feel like that, even though I think it mostly consists of frustration; partially guilt, most likely. I’m sure you had a reason to do it, and I’m sure you’re not a bad person. You just made a mistake that lead from one unfortunate event to aother. However, I would advise you to go see a psychotherapist if possible, if you ever feel like your feelings are getting out of control. But again, usually these feelings are a normal reaction (especially to trauma like this) and sometimes they stay longer than expected.', secret_id: 205474)

Comment.create(content: 'One of these things is not like the other.  Historically, at least in the past 50 decades, republicans have blown the economy to smithereens.  Democrats have cleaned up the mess and left their replacements with a deficit surplus.  For example…Clinton left Bush with a robust economy and a surplus which was exploded…Bush left Obama a gigantic deficit and monumental spending, a failing auto and banking industry…Obama fixed it, saved the auto and banking industry, and put us on a path to bring the economy back – at the same time managing to extend healthcare insurance to millions of people.  Trump is quickly decimating all those historic gains and has ALREADY increased our debt by over 2 trillion.  Again, one of these things is not like the other.', secret_id: 205362)
Comment.create(content: 'You are correct, – the Federal Reserve is not like the political parties.  The Federal Reserve is not Federal and it has no reserves. It prints all the currency (not money) out of thin air.  But that is unbelievable to most people. , It is the Federal Reserve Bank and the bankers (City of London) that control the US economy and most definitely not the political parties.  There is no such thing as a surplus as the “budget” is merely a numbers game, a show for the people. ‘ The country has been broke (bankrupt) for over 100 years, so there can be no “surplus”.  The budget only shows a projection for a year.  How about we see all the actual books and records?  Can we see the debits and credits? ‘ Want to learn more?  Probably not because like you, most are entrenched in their favorite political party and it is always the other party’s fault.  That makes it so easy and simple and you don’t have to think. ‘ For those who want to go beyond the fantasy you can see “The Hidden Secrets of Money” by Mike Maloney on YouTube.  Very educational. ‘ Also look up Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), which shows the full set of books (not just a projected budget).  The CAFR is kept quiet so the people only see next year’s budget, and not all the cash hidden funds, buried in the books.  Look up Walter  J. Burien, Jr. who discovered the CAFR and spent years publicizing it. ‘ Hey I have a 100% budget surplus this year because on paper I reduced my projected expenses to zero ( guess I won’t need any currency for food, water, clothes, shelter, etc.)  Gee I am the BEST ever because I have a 100% SURPLUS. ‘ Next year I will be in the RED INK by at least 800 million as I project that I will buy a castle in Europe, a new jet, several race cars, several summer homes and make some investments.  Damn I am way over budget; there goes my “surplus”. ‘ Ah but I waste my time writing because most will go back to their vomit in a political party.', secret_id: 205362)

Comment.create(content: 'As a woman, I can safely say that your type is the type we all try to avoid. You should rather only initiate relationships with women or sleep with people who are your type then and who you actually want to be with, instead of purposefully hurting others for your own enjoyment when you don’t see them being up to your standards. You are harming other peoples’ self image and putting in place situations and insecurities that will affect them for the rest of their lives. For no real reason at all. Obviously there is some psychological aspect here with why you do what you do, but it seems you are willingly doing this, knowing it’s wrong and knowing you are hurting others, which is worrying and not normal behavior. Honestly, you will not find your own true personal happiness by continuing this, it will eventually burn you out and either create guilt or other problems in your personal life. It also saddens me that these women you speak of are obviously very insecure hence why they continue wanting a relationship with you, even though you do not treat them with mutual respect. It shouldn’t turn you on that you’ve emotionally manipulated many innocent girls into wanting to continue a relationship with you to such an extent that, despite your poor treatment of them, they still want more. What I’ve gathered from this is that you clearly have a lot of maturing to do, and you’ve probably been through something in the past to bring on this mentality, but the fact you know that you are hurting others and still continue to do so is not okay.

Comment.create(content: 'I’ve been in the situation before where a good friend of mine cut ties with me because her girlfriend didn’t want her being friends with other girls, even though I am straight and not interested lol. It sucked and for a long time I was incredibly mad at her, but it turned out the girlfriend was threatening suicide and all kinds of things, which forced her to cut ties. My point is, even though I was incredibly angry, she approached me a few months later to apologize, where she explained she made a mistake and shared with me how she felt at the time and how she regrets cutting all of her friends off. Just having her come back and apologize, and actually show that she genuinely missed me and wanted to continue our friendship meant the world to me and we are still good friends to this day. I think you should maybe reach out to your friend and speak to him genuinely, explain your situation and feelings and I’m sure he will come around. No one is worth sacrificing good, solid friendships over, and your boyfriend should trust you enough to be friends with whoever you want, as long as you are faithful to him. It is not healthy for your partner to dictate who you may or may not be friends with as this usually is a red flag for bigger issues down the line.

Comment.create(content: 'I know I’m gonna sound like some annoying old pastor to you, but take it from a teen girl who’s felt amazing things. I wasn’t always Christian. I’ve been through extreme struggles and hardships. Stress and anxiety. I used to feel I was trapped in darkness. Jesus was always the light. I’ve felt heaven. I can safely say that I’ve even SEEN Heaven, despite it not being literal physical seeing with my eyes. It’s better than any “dimension” you could ever imagine or hope for. There is just this extreme feeling of peace and belonging. I’d never felt as at home before. I felt accepted. I felt the most amazing love. Seek Jesus. I know he’s coming back soon. You may imagine God as the same typical way many non-believers describe it, as some “old man with a beard just sitting around in the sky”, but in reality, he is this beautiful being, who is not affected by matter, space, or time. He is pure love. He is pure hope. He created every piece of beautiful scenery, ever blade of grass and grain if sand. Every human being. You may wonder, if God is so good, why does he let people die and suffer? Well there is an answer, you see God gave Angel’s and man free will. And of course as we know, one particular angel, Lucifer, turned from God at his own free will out of pride. But God wouldn’t take away our free will. So he allows us to either follow him or Lucifer. Even if you choose not to think of yourself as following either of them, you still are and you still have before, and you still will. Because of that, there is evil in this world. But that isn’t God. It’s the ability to see and feel and accept God into your heart despite the evil of your world, that makes you see just how beautiful and good he is. I see you are really searching for something greater. I promise if you just TRY too seek Jesus, you will feel the most beautiful feelings if acceptance, love, life, and peace. Trust me. And trust him. I’ll pray for you. Why don’t you start with a prayer?', secret_id: 204592)

Probably would have been more often but I never found getting knotted in my ass as a male an easy thing to accomplish by myself. I think I was 15 or 16 at those times. In my early twenties she actually caught me mounted on her female Spaniel. She was never really super mad about it just told me that I needed to be careful and not hurt her dog. She didn’t join she didn’t watch she just left me to it each time. It was just never spoken of for years. I suppose it doesn’t surprise me that much because she was a lesbian by the time she was 16. Years later she brought it up once while we were drinking and she told me that seeing me being knotted with a male dog was the reason that she ended up having a thing for videos of women being knotted by dogs.', secret_id: 204053)

Comment.create(content: 'You must be a Jewish banker.  Always stirring up trouble. . “The goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists”. quote from Jew Noel Ignatiev. . He supported the Kalergi plan (Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi).  The Jews conducted studies that proved lower IQ in blacks.  Only the whites and Asians have high enough intelligence to challenge Jewish control.  So the plan is to eliminate the whites (and then the Asians) by breeding them with the blacks. . This produces a low IQ world of brown people who will be easily controlled by the Jews.  The Jews will not be breeding with the blacks.  They aren’t stupid like you. .

Comment.create(content: 'We live in a country of stupidity and ignorance.  People are too lazy to do research about Lincoln and they WANT to believe the comfortable lies. . There were only a few large farms, called plantations, which required slaves due to the labor intensive work.  You had to be WEALTHY to afford to own slaves or live on a plantation.  That sure wasn’t most folks.  So slavery, which was being phases out due to mechanization, was NOT the Southern way of life. . People in the North had no plantations, as the growing season is too short.  Yet ALL white people are condemned for slavery, merely because they are white,  That is stupid and irrational thinking.  It was white people in the North who operated the underground railway to free black people.  So why don’t you thank the white people?  The vast majority of the whites of the South did NOT own slaves. . Many white people immigrated to this country AFTER slavery ended.  So how can they be responsible when they didn’t get here until after it was over? . But the final touch is that not one, no not even one white person alive today is responsible for slavery because NONE of them were alive way back then and not one of them owned a slave.  Yet we denigrate the whites for slavery, that they had NOTHING to do with.  Slavery ENDED in 1865.  That was a long time ago.  No one alive today was alive back then.  All the people from back then are dead. . So you will need to divert your hatred to the white people of today, who NEVER owned a slave.  Blacks should stop dwelling in the past and try living today.  Slavery is LONG since over, and you are not a slave and you NEVER have been one.  Whites don’t owe us a damn thing!  And yes I am black.', secret_id: 203781)

You can’t handle the truth, so you lie to yourself. . The Flag was the Flag of the South, the whole, not an out of context plantation here or there.  The drama about the flag has been very recently “instilled” in people so that they may be “triggered” when appropriate. . The flag was used in movies and TV shows (such as on the Dukes of Hazard) without any reaction.  Only after brainwashing was the Flag associated with slavery so that statues could be torn down and history could be re-written yet again, in an Orwell 1984 style.

I was a high class escort for many many years and had tons of fun and do not regret it, although people probably expect me to. Our sexist, patriarchal society wants us as women to feel bad about daring to live outside the “norms of society.” Screw that! You can ALWAYS create a better future for yourself. Go after your dreams and desires! As long as we are still alive, there’s always hope. Be well!', secret_id: 203540)

Comment.create(content: 'From what I read from good articles on it cuckolds are not made they are born with submissive sexual wiring and their fuse is triggered by an event in their young sexual awakening. The cuckold desire is a hot and still rising path if you see all written about it on the web. A very substantial number of men have either that fantasy or the true cuck nature. It sounds like M has the true nature and he was lucky to find a wife who apparently is a naturally dominant cuckoldress. She is a natural or she would never have the nerve to put her foot down to demand her husband must pay her for sex. The men who just have a cuck fantasy may or may not be true cucks. When the fantasy boys are actually cuckolded, many of them can’t take it and it always turns out bad. The true cucks support their wives having other men because almost all true cucks have a problem satisfying their wives either because of having a tiny cock or erection issues or other malfunctions of their main unit or all of the above. If they have problems satisfying wifey they are truly joyful and not angry when she gets sexual needs met in the arms of another man. So his need is to have a happy wife and be submissive and knowing she is sexually active and satisfied is what he gets out of it. I understand it, but I could never even imagine not satisfying my wife and she sleeps with another man. Maybe if I had a short dick or it filed to launch, I would, don’t know. This cuck sounds like a brave man to face that.', secret_id: 203294)

He says he knows he doesnt really inspire desire in his wife. Pretty plain english that is. Don’t lose sight of the main thing in play, he is her cuckold and as such he should be on the bottom of the sexual pecking order and its ok if his, tiny or limp or whatever, penis is irrelevant to her sexual satisfaction. He is a cuck! Cuckolds have no sexual priority to their cuckoldress. Sexually he is not even in the race. Both cuck and wife are happy with that.

Comment.create(content: 'First, I want to thank my wife for coming up with the idea of making me pay a Tribute to have sexual contact with her. Yes, I thank her for being strong and I love her all the more for her strength and the control she has over me. I thank my wife for the times my wife allows me to just “hump” her thigh and understand those times when she does not want a nasty mess she will make me wear a condom.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'I gladly pay to my sweet wife the Tribute due her because it is a token of my love for her; it is a token of my submission to her; it is a token of my desire for her; and it is a token that I know and accept my place in our relationship.

Comment.create(content: 'The reason that I feel this way is that no matter who ignites her desire, the fact is that I would rather my wife to enjoy being a sexual woman than not be sexual at all.

Comment.create(content: 'A vibrator or dildo is no substitute for a sweet date that includes good passionate sexual intercourse with someone you desire no matter what people might say. I share in the good aura when she has a nice “date”. I have learned tht my wife is attracted to alpha men–usually “bad boys”. But she prefers me to be submissive in our relationship because of bad experiences when in a relationship with an alpha male. I am a better husband when she keeps me submissive. When my Alpha comes out I am less thoughtful and kind towards her. My wife can have her Alpha men in bed and then come home to the warm and tender heart and the open loving arms of her cuckold.', secret_id: 203294)

Comment.create(content: 'All I m saying is that you are the god of all micro penis pathetic limp dick cucks if you let her charge you for sex and even humping her leg and you prefer another man fuck your wife rather than you owning that pussy and banging the hell out of her yourself. She makes you wear a condom to fuck or hump her. You know that wife’s best sex is found in the arms of another man. And you fucking THANK HER for all this?? I don’t know what to fucking say! Wake the fuck up dude! Your wife has you brainwashed beyond any help! You are fucked. No in reality you aren’t fucked because your wife doesn’t really want to fuck you. You are just fucked up. You know something, I don’t blame your wife. She is just doing something to get something out of shitty sex with you and extra spending money so she can feel good about tolerating you humping her and leaving her unsatisfied. I see that. I can see if you can’t excite your wife and do her like she needs because you are a limp dick cuck, she needs a man to sex her up or make love to her. I totally see that too. But you being all submissive to all this and actually fucking THANKING HER for being her cuck!?!? THAT is TOTALLY FUCKED UP!', secret_id: 203294)

Comment.create(content: 'Yes, I am 100% ok with my darling wife charging me to have sexual contact with her. Other lovers are not charged. So what? No problem there: if my wife charged other men for sex, that would be prostitution and illegal and make her subject to arrest. Totally moronic law but that’s the way it is.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'I absolutely did not say I prefer my wife to have sex with others and not me. Since I freely confess that I cannot sexually please my wife the way any healthy woman would want and need, and since we both feel that dildos and masturbation are poor substitutes for real sex, we have two good choices remaining: Option #1 is that my wife finds passion and enjoys intercourse in the arms of a man who can perform his manly duties with her. Option #2 is my wife not engaging in sex at all.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'As I wrote before, the prospect of living with a sexless woman is a horrifying thought. I love sex and I have always loved women who love sex. I have been with highly sexual and very sexually active women all my sexually active life.  I confess to being cuckolded by more than one of those women. I only know that being married to a sexless and fuckless Mother Teresa would be dull, boring and horrible. So that leaves us with only one viable choice and that choice is Option #1. 4:17pm and others have said they do not blame my wife for seeking out passion with other men if I cannot perform. So we have no problem there.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'As far as being a “limp dick cuck”, with a “micro penis”: I freely confess to being my wife’s cuck, and I am proud to be. I do confess to having a smaller than average penis. But it is not a “micro-penis”, it is approximately 10 cm or so erect, maybe a bit longer if greatly aroused.  My ability to have an erection is not an issue. The sexual “performance” issue that I experience and one of the main reasons that makes it impossible for me to have normal and satisfying intercourse with my wife is my very severe premature ejaculation. On more than one occasion, I have ejaculated when my penis just touched the outer lips of my wife’s vulva.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'I feel that I must also clarify another point. The issue of sexual “malfunction” does not just rest with me. Over the past several years, my wife has little or no natural lubrication when we attempt intercourse. And, the worst issue is that she experiences vaginismus whenever I attempt penetration any deeper than just the head of my penis. Vaginismus is the involuntary contraction of muscles around the opening of the vagina in women with no abnormalities in the genital organs. The tight muscle contraction makes sexual intercourse or any sexual activity that involves penetration painful or impossible. My wife experiences pain when I try normal full penetration.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'We have come to the realization that my wife experiences vaginismus primarily with me and is also not due simply to peri-menopausal issues. With other lovers my wife can enjoy and has enjoyed full lubrication, no vaginismus and she can have full and active penetrative sex.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'I have researched the issue and have come to the enlightened conclusion that this is because a woman’s pussy is a most honest component of her being. I have failed to satisfy my wife enough times that when my penis wants in, her subconscious mind by way of her pussy says “No way!” She not only does not get aroused by the prospect of intercourse with me, she does not lubricate, and her vagina flatly refuses entry to my penis.  Even when she masturbates and is aroused and lubricating, and even squirting when she is cumming by way of her vibrator, when add additional lube and I attempt to go in, entry is flatly denied. So the evidence points to the conclusion that the problem absolutely is an issue surrounding having intercourse with me. I can fully understand why this is so.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'It is not healthy for a woman not to have a full and active sex life. If my wife can enjoy having passionate intercourse, even if it means that she is enjoying it in another man’s bed, I am all for it. Thus, Option #1 prevails and I not only fully accept it, I greatly encourage it.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'Another factor comes into play here and is worth delving into: My wife confesses to being drawn to and sexually attracted by more or less dominant alpha men, and no so much toward submissive men. But a lot of those macho alpha men are “bad boys”, and while she has had great sex with them, she has experienced more or less unsuccessful romantic relations with the bad boys with some even being abusive. So part of the “Entry Denied” problem might have to do with my sexual status with her and my being a submissive cuckold and not the alpha male type that her vagina will freely get wet for and invite inside.', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'The Conclusion: I am a true Alpha/cuck “switch” and not simply just a sub male. But both my wife and I have come to to realize that when I am in “alpha male mode” I am not as kind and thoughtful and loving towards my wife as I am when she brings out the submissive cuckold in me. When my wife cuckolds me, it puts me into a submissive head space and we both note that I am a more attentive, thoughtful and a nicer person. I am more focused on her feelings and more balanced generally. I am a better husband. Even I like myself more when she keeps me in a submissive cuckold head space!', secret_id: 203294)
Comment.create(content: 'If the choice is between, being an alpha male [and a potential jerk and ], “owning” my wife’s pussy and fucking her brains out; and, having a sweet loving and harmonious marriage relationship with her. I gladly choose the latter even if it also means I pay for sex, she seeks her sexual passion elsewhere, and I get shit from those morons who do not understand and do not want to understand.', secret_id: 203294)

Comment.create(content: 'I confessed to my wife about a year ago that while married to my ex and in a basically sexless marriage that I use to pay high class hookers for sexual favors. Now she says that she feels shortchanged and wants me to start paying her for sex. After reading the cuckold’s confession and the comments for and against, I am torn between liking the idea and finding it crazy. My wife is miffed at my resistance because she says I value their pussy above her’s and she knows she is worth what she is asking me to pay. Since money is no problem, and my wife said she would even throw in some of the stuff the hookers did to indulge my kinks, I am leaning towards paying her. I know, crazy, right?', secret_id: 203294)

I also assume a fairly religious person. Maybe even a nun at one time. I don’t know, but yeah from what my friends talked about, I assumed nun, even though she was dressed professional. But the thing is she was wearing scrappy shoes, painted toes and her feet were very visible and so fucking hot I couldn’t even believe it. So fucking nice. Mind blowing.

Comment.create(content: 'Hey, I don’t really know what’s causing you to do this, but whatever it is, remember there’s people around you Who care about you, and who want to help you get through this. I’m assuming you’re doing this as a way to release all your pain, but the thing is, it’s not actually making the pain go away. Doing this is only going to make it worse, trust me, as you’re only adding more pain to yourself. So instead of trying to get rid of your feelings this way, try talking to friends, family, or a therapist, (as they can REALLY help and they’re professionals) i’m sure they’ll help you through this, talk about your problems to them, not to yourself. And I mean, you already managed to stop for 3 months, which believe it or not, it’s progress, as you know you managed to stop once, so you can stop again. Self harm is an extrimelly hard thing to get out of, and that’s why you should not be trying to deal with it alone. Remember I’m not a professional, but I do hope this helps you remember that you’re not alone, that you can stop again. It might take time and effort, but at the end, it WILL be worth it. Sending much love and wishing you the best, and trust me, It will get better!!❤️ (Sorry if there’s any spelling mistakes, English is not my first language!😆)', secret_id: 203132)

I took his cock out anyway, wasn’t big but it a was nice 4 inches or so and proportional and it was clean so I started sucking his dick. I remember thinking, “I can’t believe I actually have a cock in my mouth right now.” THEN I started to get hard. He was sitting on my bed and I was on the floor..my bed didn’t have a bedframe. I grabbed his hips and, without taking his dick out of my mouth started to roll. I wanted him to fuck my face. He got that figured out without words. I was being shy. I figured we would cum in my mouth and I started jerking myself off to get the timing such that I could cum when, or immediately after him. I knew I probably shouldn’t do it before. But that’s not what happened. Instead, he pushed me up on the bed and got in between my legs. I was like, “I’m not sure I want you to fuck my ass.” He told me to “just relax.” I told him I wasn’t ready and to just keep it in my mouth. He was annoyed, so I was like, “maybe if I turn over” I got on my hands and knees and immediately was like ,”no.” It just didn’t feel right and I had not prepared my ass in anyway. Now he’s really annoyed and was just like “here” and put it back in my mouth and fucked my face pretty aggressively. He came. My gag reflex kicked in because he came like right down my throat. He fell asleep. I went to the bathroom and jerked off, took me all of 3 seconds. I did eventually let him do me in the ass as part of a threesome and with our gf’s guidance (and encouragement, I did anything she wanted).', secret_id: 203066)

Actually I notice lately whenever I am interested, I end up cock blocked by some loser who is in fact jealous. It happens a lot in the past few years from different dudes who really are not as good as I am. He usually doesn’t get it either, they are just jealous that I don’t even try and there it is. So IF I am interested (not very often) I keep it to myself to avoid stupid complications. I don’t really have many friends either. I am the kind of guy, you get the meanest bitch in the place, every single person you talk to about her all they ever say is “that woman is nasty” “that woman is a bitch” you give me a very short amount of time, I am the only one in the world she is not nasty to and people will notice that.

Comment.create(content: 'Personality matters a lot. Looks still do matter as well but some details are more important than others, especially when interconnected with their personality. A sexy person who dresses like absolute garbage and does not take care of their body may be less attractive than an average person who consistently dresses nicely and obviously cares about their body and appearance. Stuff like clothing, makeup, hair style, acne, piercings, they are associated with “looks” but are really associated with personality, and in my opinion, are more important than one’s actual skin colour, facial features, etc. Now I’m going to leave you with a couple of difficult questions. What would you do if there was someone who had purple hair, skinny jeans, and excessive makeup, but came across as a caring person who just wanted to express themselves in a unique way? If her looks are directly connected to her personality, would it mean that looks matter? Would you still hang out with that person despite hating how she looks due to her personality? Are you sure that the person chose to dress this way due to her personality? In my entire opinion, I refer to “personality” as her ideas, beliefs, and behaviors. Someone may make themselves look weird like the person I mentioned above on account of her wanting to try new things or being easily influenced by someone else to dress that way. Would you like the person then for each of those two reasons?', secret_id: 202716)

After a year, if not less, we got along so well that clients and even our own business group would ask or assume that we were together. We did look the part, too. Went to a function one night, dressed up, and a local magazine took our picture (they were there for most events). I was in a suit, and she was wearing an off the shoulder, red dress that I bought her when we were doing in person stops one afternoon. She was jaw-dropping that night, and, at my side. The photog ended up using us for the story’s main photo. Hell, even a friend of mine who knew I was married saw it and told me “You look good together, like you’re in love”.', secret_id: 202712)

Comment.create(content: 'So the argument that age difference doesn’t matter is completely wrong. It depends on the time period of age difference and maturity. When you are twelve or seventeen, our understanding of sex and agency is very murky. At these ages, you are still trying to learn about yourself and understand the changes of your body, especially in mental understandings of certain beliefs such as consent. You as a seventeen year old, unintentionally, is manipulating this girl. She thinks she likes you and wants to be with you, but its simply the allure of being with an older man which is intriguing for her. YOU don’t see this because you’re also young and thinks this is “true love”, but you’re older than her and your understanding of ” free will” is different than hers. If she was 20 and you were 25, then the situation is different. Why? Because you both have grown and come to understand your bodies and what you dont and do like. Sex can be beautiful but also scary. We can sometimes end up feeling like we are in healthy situation but at the end its the peer pressure of the world alongside us that makes teenage sex normal. I say this from experience. I’m 21 years old now but when I was 13, I was in “love” with this 18 year old. BUt he was more interested in getting it in and I was stupid into thinking that well its an older who is like super into me which is cool. But it wasn’t because later on, I realized I was just young girl who thought his creepy older guy was cool even though I was barely developing as a woman and learning about myself. I didnt have sex with him but the potential trauma I could’ve gotten would have affected me in the long run. I personally think you should cut it off and just talk with each other. Your hormones is mainly doing the talking but not you two .', secret_id: 202614)

Comment.create(content: 'Its never a good thing to generalize. I am a feminist. Before putting down ALL feminists, please understand that the main concept behind feminism is that us women want to be treated as equals to our male counterparts. We desire to be paid the same salary as a man makes, for example. In the year 2019, this is not a reality for all women. We had to fight for the right to vote. We used to be treated as property in the institution of “marriage.” In my country, (America), I  am given much more freedom as a female than countless of my sisters do in other countries. “Sharia Law” is in effect as I write this in Saudi Arabia, and several other countries. It is an extremely misogynistic and oppressive set of laws created by a patriarchal society that makes it legal to treat women as second class citizens. Google it. It is too much for me to write about here, and is frankly too horrifying and depressing to get into detail about. Essentially, feminism exists because of the inequalities that us women have to live and deal with from the day we are born until the day we die. If you think about it, men created feminism. If we were treated as equal human beings from the very  start, then there would not be a need for feminism to exist. Now, the bullshit regarding feminism being all about  “hatred of men” is a made up lie created by a man to take the focus off of the fact that women are generally treated like shit all over the world and men rule the fucking planet and make all the rules!!', secret_id: 202470)

Comment.create(content: 'Yo i’m in the same boat with depression and i can assure you that its normal to have these after shocks. You will have good days, and you will have bad days. The important thing is to not SURRENDER. Sometimes its easy as hell to be like ‘its harder to fight to not be depressed, so i’ll stop fighting’. Don’t do that. Also if you don’t already have a therapist, one might help if only to get some occasional advice from, since they’d have heard lots of things about depression', secret_id: 202198)
Comment.create(content: 'Don’t worry, I’ll never surrender. I’m just scared because those after shocks could hit me at any moment. As I said, I don’t want to worry others, but I’m selfish, too, cause I don’t want others to think I play the damsel in distress. It’s been roughly 4 years now that I finally found the light, I just hope those after shocks don’t last the rest of my life. With my friends I actually always feel like I help them, but if I need help…I found out yesterday evening that’s not true and that my best friend really is my best friend trying to cheer me up when I was crying. Thank you for your advice and even if it sounds weird, but if you need advice, just tell me. I don’t want other people to feel the same way I felt before, I want to help', secret_id: 202198)

Can take help from her.she would never want the trem depression to be used before her,and iam only telling you because this is how i felt.she can be completelt different of how she behaves about it.sometimes they dont want to open up about it .May be you can apply another technique,you can give her hints of how you felt how you felt bad about something or peson particularly,and just make the way for her to walk.if you suddenly bump a question shel get shocked,And one doesnt like to be questioned in this particular mental state.Trust me it matters for her that you care I feel oversensitive and overthinking ppl are particularly prone to be dip into this mental state where they become silent and unreactive.But your help can go long way.Do whatever you can possibly do.:) 🙂 And youre realy a great friend,Thanks for being there for her dear person!!', secret_id: 202164)

I have no idea how long they were beside me in the left lane before they honked.  One of my rare forum type experiences, the stayed beside me until I came.

I have only been in two threesomes in my life.  One was with two men.  The one that was with a male female couple involved me going down on her while he fucked her, she did not really process at the time that I was giving his cock as much oral attention as I was giving her pussy; he was a man I had sucked multiple times and had arranged the threesome.  He told me later that she later was freaked out that when he was ready to cum, he had pulled out and finished in my mouth.  She was just too caught up in it at the time.', secret_id: 201976)

Comment.create(content: 'This is the original poster. Actually, I am currently living with the love of my life as I write this. He is the best man I have ever had the pleasure of being in a monogamous, intimate relationship with, and even HE is abusive to me sometimes. Me, “fat,” you say? Hardly. Needy? Not true. Unmotivated? Not in a million years. Me being unmarried is true; as far as me being “unwanted,” well, that is definitely false. I just think it’s in a man’s nature to be abusive to his female counterpart. He inherently thinks of himself as superior due to being able to enjoy life in a misogynistic and patriarchal society that he so carefully created to benefit HIM and HIS “brothers.” What really amuses me is that he also so nicely created racism, classism, ageism, etc. to keep other types of people oppressed and “in line.” Men will never “change” their abusive ways. They love the ugly reality of the dysfunctional society that we live in  and are not in the least bit interesed in striving for “world peace,” for example. That will never happen.  America (my country) is “supposed” to be a progressive and “free” country, but now we have a guy like Donald Trump running the show! What a fucking joke. Imagine that; a character like HIM representing the United States of America!! I am both disgusted and ashamed to have been born here. Well, at least one of my parents is European!

In my opinion its better than Religion. It’s real. I see religion as basically just a handbook of being good according to whatever bible it’s written in. No more. I don’t believe it will get you anywhere. When you die, you’ll get blackness and know nothing else. That’s what I believe based on what I know about life, science, biology, chemistry. Reality. Shit you can see, it’s real, it’s logically, and it makes sense. It’s all a fluke, but I do believe that good parenting and influence can prevent the negative from a person who doesn’t fear god. I find it strange that people actually fear something that logically is not there. It’s just not real. It’s probably why my parents were pretty much the generation that didn’t do church. Baptised Catholic, but I heve never in my life been to church on Sunday. I once asked my mother why she didn’t go to my uncle’s funeral. Dad’s side. They were good friends even after my parents divorce. Respect. She said it didn’t matter because she believes in respect while they’re alive. That’s the kind of thing I was raised on. No religion.

Comment.create(content: 'Every system of control and order has limits. Capitalism is no different. Only an idiot with no imagination thinks that capitalism is the ultimate system that will last forever. As we evolved from the apes through to today, our social orders have changed to accommodate more members. The initial social order of our ancestors was as pack animals. Those packs are only workable up to around 30-40 members. Beyond that, you start getting competition from other “alphas” and the pack divides. Then we moved on to villages. Those could only handle about 100-200 members. Then towns. Cities. Kingdoms. Nations. Each increasing the number of members it could manage. Along with each, more subsystems of control were developed. Capitalism is one of those systems. Just like communism failed in the 90s, capitalism is failing now. Think I’m wrong? Remember back in the 1970s when we used to see the citizens of the U.S.S.R. lining up to get their government issued clothing allotment for a year? Low quality clothes versus what we had here. They’re barely make it through the year, but our clothes could make it to second and third hand use. Fast forward to today and the shit that Walmart sells barely lasts a few months. Remember the riots we’d see on our TVs from the U.S.S.R. over the government rationed goods in the 1970s? Compare that with Black Friday. Zero difference. We just dress it up with wrapping paper and a bow. When was the last time you bought something and it didn’t break within 6 months to two years? The consolidation of power into the hands of just a few corporations is no different from the consolidation of power to the corrupted government of the U.S.S.R. Increasingly, Americans only have a handful of places to get goods, but those goods are largely manufactured by a handful of companies. And freedom? Don’t make me laugh. We lost our freedom starting with George Bush Sr. He enslaved us to war for corporate power instead of for the good of global society. Our goals in WW II may not have been pure, but they weren’t for protecting and hijacking valuable assets for wealthy businesses like the first War for Oil in the 90s. Yes, capitalism is failing and it should because it’s time is running out. Within the next decade or two, most goods will be manufactured by automated systems, likely using recycled materials for advanced, high resolution 3D printing. Just as music and television and movies are essentially worthless today compared to before digital distribution, the same thing will happen with physical goods. Want to hear a song? What do you do today? You go to YouTube, search for it and listen after skipping the annoying ad. Did you pay for anything other than your internet access bill? No. You didn’t. Want to watch a real TV show (not the online exclusives, I’m talking TV shows from before digital distribution)? You just look for it on YouTube, Dailymotion, or even Amazon and IMDBs’s free service Freedive and watch. You pay nothing. Don’t even talk about the piracy angle and everything that’s available there. Just imagine what life will be like when you can just as easily pirate a set of 3D printed plates or furniture. Combine it with nanotechnology to get even higher resolution and more flexible and accurate “printing” and… everything becomes worthless only as long as your mind is married to capitalism. The sad thing is, we should be excited about machines taking over our jobs. It means we don’t HAVE to work anymore. We should be excited that goods and services are getting cheaper or even free (quality issues aside). All of this means we’re on the edge of abundance and being able to provide for everyone as long as we can lose the constraints of capitalism. Imagine a completely automated factory that can make anything you need and it does it by molecularly disassembling garbage and turning it into useful things like wood, plastic, metal, etc… All you have to do is feed it things we don’t want and then take the things you do want. How does capitalism work in that environment? If the assholes (business leaders and politicians) who were in charge in the 1960s through the 1990s were serious about running things, they would have planned for this. The fact is they had no idea because they were idiots when it came to seeing where technology was going. They’re STILL idiots. Look no further than MongoDB stock. I bought some at $74 a share back in September. An idiot named Christopher Eberle (stock analyst) downgrades the stock saying it’s not compelling and… the stock drops close the $63 target he set within a week. Not because anything happened to the company. Not because the product sucks. But simply because other invstors blindly followed this idiot not having a clue about what MongoDB actually does and why it’s valuable. Instead investors hear that it’s a database and they immediately think, “oh like Oracle”. Then they make moronic assumptions about MongoDB based on zero facts. The primary fact being that while MongoDB IS a database it is totally different in nature and application from a database like Oracle. Thankfully, that bonehead Eberle, who apparently doesn’t research anything, was wrong and the price climbed back up to where it was before over the next few weeks. I didn’t worry because I know more than Eberle. I knew it would come back up no matter what Jedi mind tricks he tried pulling with the market. Right now (check the date of this post) MongoDB is worth $85 a share. Suck it Eberle, you tool! And you trust these idiots with the market whether you’re an investor or not. These are the people telling you capitalism is great. It’s not. It’s dying (and it should). We need to work towards a society where anything that can be free, is free. We need to work towards a society where capitalism has been replaced with an economic system that functions better in a world where there are no jobs. We need to build a society where you can focus on doing what you most desire as your life goal, and that you can change that goal as much as you want with no penalties. These technologies can enable that. This is why it’s essential to move to natural, renewable energy sources with electricity being the primary form of energy. The new currency should be information, both dispersion and mining of it. Once machines are adept enough to be able to take care of that, the next phase we need to prepare for is merging with these new life forms. It WILL happen. It MUST happen. By merging with them, we can prevent our own obsolescence. You have been annointed with the word of truth. Pass it on. Take it from this site and post it where all can see. We will end MAGA because it’s a meaningless slogan. Make America Great for who? What does great actually mean? The phrase means nothing because Trump is grand idiot of the planet number one. Fuck you MAGA idiots. You know nothing about reality or life. Get fucked.', secret_id: 201724)

Provided Dad wasn’t in Galaxy B when you were in Galaxy A. you would have to be able to feel all the galaxies with your spirit at one time in order to be able to determine whether or not God was not in any of them or was in any of them. And because it’s impossible for you to do this. Or for anyone else to do this. The only way that you can possibly say that God does not exist is to have blind Faith in that statement. Because there’s absolutely no evidence to support it! Now evidence that supports God’s existence is miracles. if there is even one miracle it is proof that God exists.

I haven’t had a man do any of that before.  I did feel a bit violated but its part of a health checkup.  Please don’t let it bother you by over-thinking.

The fact That she liked me and showed it in certain ways really made me like her too. I needed it and I appreciated it and she won me over. Then for some reason, she changed suddenly. I know it wasn’t me, and I do suspect certain other people who were assholes, were jealous of me and maybe said something to her. Trashed me somehow out of jealousy (Ive seen one in action a few times, another younger guy than me who really wasn’t as good as me in quite few ways). I don’t know for sure but I suspect. She changed. She was cold to me. She wouldn’t even say hi to me. It hurt too. So eventually I just stopped saying anything to her  I avoided her. And she eventually came around again but then I had to leave. But I did think about her. She had a boyfriend. They broke up. I let her go for a while to soak it in, avoid rebound, then one day maybe a few weeks after my birthday I signed up for Facebook just to reach out to her. She seemed down, her boyfriend and her were together 5 years, selarted for 5 or 6 months (I would check her twitter and facebook even though I dont do social media) her first, she needed time. 5 months, I figured she was alone for a while, she wants some love, so do I, I’m going to hit her up. I did. And she politely turned me down because of our age gap. I understood. I hung around for a few weeks, and then didn’t want to feel like a creep or wart just there, so I closed my account and left it. She started seeing a new guy around her age a few weeks later. I always did believe there could be something good even for a while, she did like me, but I could never do that again. I can’t bring myself to. She said no and for a good honest reason. I can’t be that guy.', secret_id: 201512)

You may never know the answer to that question and that is okay. taking steps forward into positivity is great following a breakup. It is good to dig deeper into the root cause of trauma that this breakup triggered and how you can heal that root trauma. The root trauma usually stems from hurt in our childhood such as abandonment as an example and we attract the type of people who will trigger that original trauma. And until that original trauma is resolved you will continue to find yourself in relationships parallel to this one. Happy healing and lots of light to you.', secret_id: 200719)

I don’t know how she felt about me way back then, but when I saw her many years later, I could tell there was something which justified my love to me. If I had doubts, and I never did tbh, they were gone just by her expression and the way she moved, looking. I wasn’t good enough. I like to say “confidence” but it was a lot more than that  better clothes, nicer haircut, to be starting to do something in my life. It’s self esteem, its true, and its one of those times I wished I was better. That didn’t happen for a few more years. But yeah. I love her and nothing since has ever gotten rid of it completely. I could never push her away or disrespect her now either. Not intentionally. Sometimes I fantasize I bump into her somewhere alone amd I can behave normal amd be myself, because I could and would, I have to women I suspect for a second ARE but they’re not and hopefully if we did rrun into each other she recognizes it and me.

Please don’t do any of those things to change your appearance it would be sad, I personally think that natural beauty is the most attractive and it sounds like he probably does to. The fact that you don’t wear makeup or have cosmetic surgery and you lift weights (so I’m guessing your fit and strong, athletic) are probably all things he likes about you.', secret_id: 200143)
